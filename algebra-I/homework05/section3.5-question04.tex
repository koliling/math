Section 3.5 Question 4:
Show that $S_n=\langle(12),(123\ldots n)\rangle$ for all $n\geq2$.
\begin{proof}
  Because all permutations can be decomposed into finite products of
  transpositions, it suffices to show that $(12)$ and $(123\ldots n)$
  generate all transpositions. Also, because any transposition $(ab)$ is
  the product $(ab)=(1a)(1b)(1a)$, it suffices to show that $(12)$ and
  $(123\ldots n)$ generate all transpositions of the form $(1a)$. \\
  
  We first show by induction on $n$ that the set of transpositions
  $S=\{(12),(23),\ldots,(n-1\;n)\}$ will generate all transpositions of the
  form $T=\{(12),(13),\ldots,(1n)\}$: Clearly $S$ generates $(12)$. To
  generate $(13)$, we use $(13)=(12)(23)(12)$. Repeating this argument, we
  can generate $(1a)$ by using $(1a)=(1\;a-1)(a-1\;a)(1\;a-1)$, where
  $(1\;a-1)$ is generated by $S$ from induction hypothesis. This completes
  the claim. \\

  Hence, it suffices to show that $(12)$ and $(123\ldots n)$ generates all
  transpositions in \[S=\{(12),(23),\ldots,(n-1\;n)\}.\] This statement is
  true because $(k\;k+1)=(12\ldots n)^{k}(12)(12\ldots n)^{-k}$, which
  completes the proof.
\end{proof}
