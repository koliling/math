Section 4.2 Question 6:
Let $r$ and $s$ be the usual generators for the dihedral group of order 8
and let $N=\langle r^2\rangle$. List the left cosets of $N$ in $D_8$ as
$1N$, $rN$, $sN$, and $srN$. Label these cosets with the integers 1,2,3,4
respectively. Exhibit the image of each element of $D_8$ under the
representation $\pi_N$ of $D_8$ into $S_4$ obtained from the action of
$D_8$ by left multiplication on the set of 4 left cosets of $N$ in $D_8$.
Deduce that this representation is not faithful and prove that $\pi_N(D_8)$
is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group.

\begin{proof}
  $N=\langle r^2\rangle=\{1,r^2\}$. Under the given representation, $\pi_N$
  can be summarized in the following table:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
      \hline
      $g\in D_8$ & $\pi_N(g)\in S_4$ \\
      \hline\hline
      $1$     & $(1)$ \\
      $r$     & $(12)(34)$ \\
      $r^2$   & $(1)$ \\
      $r^3$   & $(12)(34)$ \\
      $s$     & $(13)(24)$ \\
      $sr$    & $(14)(23)$ \\
      $sr^2$  & $(13)(24)$ \\
      $sr^3$  & $(14)(23)$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  This representation is not faithful since $\ker(\pi_N)\neq\{1\}$.
  From the table, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \pi_N(D_8)=\{(1),(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\}.
  \end{equation*}
  Each non-identity element has order 2, and the group has order 4, which
  makes it isomorphic to the Klein-4 group.
\end{proof}
