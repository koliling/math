Section 4.3 Question 24: Assume $H$ is a proper subgroup of the finite
group $G$. Prove $G\neq\cup_{g\in G}gHg^{-1}$.

\begin{proof}
  Given proper subgroup $H$ of finite group $G$, let $M$ be the maximal
  proper subgroup of $G$ that contains $H$. $M$ exists because $G$ is
  finite and hence can only have a finite number of subgroups. Then we have
  \begin{align*}
    |\cup_{g\in G}gHg^{-1}|  &\leq|\cup_{g\in G}gMg^{-1}| & \\
                             &\leq(|M|-1)|G:M|  & (\text{Question 23,
                              Section 4.3}) \\
                             &<|G|, & \\
  \end{align*}
  which implies that $\cup_{g\in G}gHg^{-1}$ cannot equal $G$.
\end{proof}
