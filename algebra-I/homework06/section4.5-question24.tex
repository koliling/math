Section 4.5 Question 24: Prove that if $G$ is a group of order 231 then
$Z(G)$ contains a Sylow 11-subgroup of $G$ and a Sylow 7-subgroup is normal
in $G$.

\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a group of order $231=3\cdot7\cdot11$. From the Sylow
  theorems, $n_{11}$ divides $3\cdot7$ and equals 1 modulo 11, hence
  $n_{11}$ can only be 1. Then Corollary 20 says the only Sylow 11-subgroup
  $P_{11}$ is normal in $G$. Now from Proposition 13 of Section 4.4,
  $G/C_G(P_{11})$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\text{Aut}(P_{11})$. From
  Proposition 17.1 of Section 4.4, $\text{Aut}(P_{11})$ has order 10. So
  from Lagrange's theorem, $|G/C_G(P_{11})|$ must divide 10, yet it must
  also divide $|G|=231$. Hence $|G/C_G(P_{11})|=1$, which implies
  $C_G(P_{11})=G$. Thus every element of $G$ commutes with every element of
  $P_{11}$, so $P_{11}\leq Z(G)$. \\

  From the Sylow theorems, $n_{7}$ divides $3\cdot11$ and equals 1 modulo
  7, hence $n_{7}$ can only be 1. Then Corollary 20 says the only Sylow
  11-subgroup $P_{7}$ is normal in $G$. 
\end{proof}
