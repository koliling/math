Section 4.5 Question 49: Prove that if $|G|=2^nm$ where $m$ is odd and $G$
has a cyclic Sylow 2-subgroup then $G$ has a nromal subgroup of order $m$.

\begin{proof}
  We prove the claim by induction on $n$. For $n=1$, by Exercise 12 of
  Section 4.2, we have a subgroup of index 2. Since the index is 2, the
  subgroup is normal. Also, since $|G|=2m$, this normal subgroup has order
  $m$, as required. \\

  Consider the inductive step $n+1$.
\end{proof}
