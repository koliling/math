\it \textbf{Section 12.2 Q3:} Prove that two $2\times2$ matrices over $F$
  which are not scalar matrices are similar if and only if they have the
  same characteristic polynomial.
  \begin{proof}
    We first show that similar matrices have the same characteristic
    polynomial. Given similar matrices $A$ and $P^{-1}AP$,
    \begin{align*}
      \text{char}(P^{-1}AP) &=|xI-P^{-1}AP|\\
      &=|P(xI-P^{-1}AP)P^{-1}|\\
      &=|P(xI)P^{-1}-A|\\
      &=|xI-A|\\
      &=\text{char}(A).\\
    \end{align*}

    For the converse, let $A,B\in\text{Mat}_2(F)$ be two non-scalar
    matrices over with the same characteristic polynomial. Assume the
    characteristic polynomial of $A$ and $B$ has distinct roots. Write
    \[c_A(x) =c_B(x) =(x-\alpha)(x-\beta),\]
    where $\alpha\neq\beta\in F$.
    Then $A$ and $B$ must also have the same minimal polynomial which
    equals their characteristic polynomial, by Proposition 20.3. Thus from
    Theorem 15, matrices $A$ and $B$ are similar.\\

    On the other hand, if the roots of the characteristic polynomial are
    not distinct, i.e.
    \[c_A(x)=c_B(x)=(x-\alpha)^2\]
    for some $\alpha\in F$, then $m_A(x)$ is either $x-\alpha$ or
    $(x-\alpha)^2$. If $m_A(x)=x-\alpha$, then the invariant factors of $A$
    are $x-\alpha$ and $x-\alpha$, which implies that the rational
    canonical form of $A$ is $\alpha I$. Now since $A$ is similar to its
    rational canonical form $\alpha I$,we have $A=Q^{-1}(\alpha I)Q=\alpha
    I$ for some invertible matrix $Q\in\text{Mat}_2(F)$, which makes $A$ a
    scalar matrix, a contradiction. Therefore we must have
    $m_A(x)=m_B(x)=(x-\alpha)^2$, and so $A$ and $B$ have the same rational
    canonical form, making them similar by Theorem 15.
  \end{proof}

\it \textbf{Section 12.2 Q4:} Prove that two $3\times3$ matrices are
  similar if and only if they have the same characteristic and same minimal
  polynomial. Give an explicit counterexample to this assertion for
  $4\times4$ matrices.

  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}

\it \textbf{Section 12.2 Q6:} Prove that the constant term in the
  characteristic polynomial of the $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is
  $(-1)^n\text{det}A$ and that the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is the negative
  of the sum of the diagonal entries of $A$ (the sum of the diagonal
  entries of $A$ is called the trace of $A$). Prove that $\text{det}A$ is
  the product of the eigenvalues of $A$ and that the trace of $A$ is the
  sum of the eigenvalues of $A$.
