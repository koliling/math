\it \textbf{DF 13.3.1:} Prove that it is impossible to construct a regular
  9-gon.

  \begin{proof}
    If we can construct a regular 9-gon, then by marking the mid-point of
    the edges of the 9-gon and drawing a line through the mid-point and the
    opposite corner of the 9-gon, we can find identify the center of the
    9-gon with compass and ruler (it is known that we can use a compass and
    ruler to identify the mid-point of any given line). By drawing a line
    from the each of the 9 corners of the 9-gon to the center of the
    9-gon, we obtain partition the 9-gon into 9 identical isosceles
    triangles that meet at the center of the 9-gon. Now the angle of each
    triangle at the corner that touches the center of the 9-gon is
    $2\pi/9$. We can half the angle to construct an angle of degree
    $\pi/9$, which is not constructible, and thus a contradiction.
  \end{proof}
