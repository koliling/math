\it \textbf{DF 13.3.1:} Prove that it is impossible to construct a regular
  9-gon.

  \begin{proof}
    If we can construct a regular 9-gon, then by marking the mid-point of
    the edges of the 9-gon and drawing a line through the mid-point and the
    opposite corner of the 9-gon, we can find identify the center of the
    9-gon with compass and ruler (it is known that we can use a compass and
    ruler to identify the mid-point of any given line). By drawing a line
    from the each of the 9 corners of the 9-gon to the center of the
    9-gon, we obtain partition the 9-gon into 9 identical isosceles
    triangles that meet at the center of the 9-gon. Now the angle of each
    triangle at the corner that touches the center of the 9-gon is
    $2\pi/9$. We can half the angle to construct an angle of degree
    $\pi/9$, which is not constructible, and thus a contradiction.
  \end{proof}

\it \textbf{DF 13.3.4:} The construction of the regular 7-gon amounts to
  the constructibility of $\cos(2\pi/7)$. We shall see later that
  $\alpha=2\cos(2\pi/7)$ satisfies the equation $x^3+x^2-2x-1=0$. Use this
  to prove that the regular 7-gon is not constructible by straightedge and
  compass.

  \begin{proof}
    The given polynomial has no roots in $\mathbb{Z}$ since neither 1 nor
    -1 is a root. Therefore from Gauss's lemma, the polynomial has no roots
    in $\mathbb{Q}$. So since the polynomial has degree three and has no
    linear roots, it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore
    $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]=3$. Now if the regular 7-gon is
    constructible, then $\alpha$ is constructible, yet
    $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]$ is not a power of 2, a contradiction.
  \end{proof}

\it \textbf{DF 13.3.5:} Use the fact that $\alpha=2\cos(2\pi/5)$ satisfies
  the equation $x^2+x-1=0$ to conclude that the regular 5-gon is
  constructible by straightedge and compass.

  \begin{proof}
    Since $\alpha$ is a real root of a quadratic polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$,
    it can be expressed using a series of addition, multiplication,
    division, and/or square roots of rationals. Since these operations are
    constructible by a straightedge and compass, $\alpha$ is constructible.
    Then by bisecting angles (which is also known to be constructible), we
    can construct $\alpha/2=\cos(2\pi/5)$. \\

    With a line of length $\cos(2\pi/5)$ constructed, we construct the
    degree $2\pi/5$ as follows: draw a perpendicular line from one end of
    the line upwards (perpendicular lines from a given line are known to be
    constructible). Then setting the compass to a length of 1, mark the
    point where the other end of the line of length $\cos(2\pi/5)$ meets
    the perpendicular line. Then draw a line from this end of the line to
    the marked point. The angle at the other end of the line will have
    degree $2\pi/5$. \\

    Repeating this process 5 times we can construct the symmetrical sides
    of the 5 isosceles triangles that when put together, form a 5-gon.
  \end{proof}

\it \textbf{DF 13.4.1:} Determine the splitting field and its degree over
  $\mathbb{Q}$ for $x^4-2$.

  \begin{proof}
    This polynomial has four distinct roots $\{\sqrt[4]{2}, -\sqrt[4]{2},
    \sqrt[4]{2}i, -\sqrt[4]{2}i\}$. These roots lie in
    $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2},i)$, thus the splitting field must lie in this
    field extension. Also, any field extension that contains the roots
    $\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $\sqrt[4]{2}i$ must also contain
    $i=\sqrt[4]{2}i/\sqrt[4]{2}$, therefore the splitting field is exactly
    $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2},i)$. \\

    To compute $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2},i):\mathbb{Q}]
    =[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2},i):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})]
    [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}):\mathbb{Q}]$, we first compute
    $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}):\mathbb{Q}]$. The irreducible polynomial of
    $\sqrt[4]{2}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ divides $x^4-2$. Now $x^4-2$ is
    irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Gauss's Lemma since $\pm1$, $\pm2$ are
    not roots of the polynomial. Therefore
    $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}):\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Also,
    $i\not\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$, and the irreducible polynomial of
    $i$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2+1$, thus
    $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2},i):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})]=2$ and
    $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2},i):\mathbb{Q}]=4\cdot2=8$.
  \end{proof}

\it \textbf{DF 13.4.2:} Determine the splitting field and its degree over
  $\mathbb{Q}$ for $x^4+2$.

  \begin{proof}
    This polynomial has four distinct roots $\{\pm2^{-1/4}(1+i),
    \pm2^{-1/4}(1-i)\}$. These roots lie in $\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i)$, thus
    the splitting field must lie in this field extension. Also, any field
    extension that contains the roots $2^{-1/4}(1+i)$ and $2^{-1/4}(1-i)$
    must also contain $2^{-1/4}=(2^{-1/4}(1+i) +2^{-1/4}(1-i))/2$. Hence
    such an extension must also contain $i=2^{-1/4}(1+i)/2^{-1/4}-1$.
    Therefore the splitting field is exactly $\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i)$. \\

    To compute $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}]
    =[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4})]
    [\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4}):\mathbb{Q}]$, we first compute
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4}):\mathbb{Q}]$. The irreducible
    polynomial of $2^{-1/4}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ divides $2x^4-1$. Now
    $2x^4-1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Gauss's Lemma. Therefore
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4}):\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Also,
    $i\not\in\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4})$, and the irreducible polynomial of
    $i$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2+1$, thus
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4})]=2$ and
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}]=4\cdot2=8$.
  \end{proof}

\it \textbf{DF 13.4.3:} Determine the splitting field and its degree over
  $\mathbb{Q}$ for $x^4+x^2+1$.

  \begin{proof}
    This polynomial has four distinct roots $\{\pm2^{-1/4}(1+i),
    \pm2^{-1/4}(1-i)\}$. These roots lie in $\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i)$, thus
    the splitting field must lie in this field extension. Also, any field
    extension that contains the roots $2^{-1/4}(1+i)$ and $2^{-1/4}(1-i)$
    must also contain $2^{-1/4}=(2^{-1/4}(1+i) +2^{-1/4}(1-i))/2$. Hence
    such an extension must also contain $i=2^{-1/4}(1+i)/2^{-1/4}-1$.
    Therefore the splitting field is exactly $\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i)$. \\

    To compute $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}]
    =[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4})]
    [\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4}):\mathbb{Q}]$, we first compute
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4}):\mathbb{Q}]$. The irreducible
    polynomial of $2^{-1/4}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ divides $2x^4-1$. Now
    $2x^4-1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Gauss's Lemma. Therefore
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4}):\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Also,
    $i\not\in\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4})$, and the irreducible polynomial of
    $i$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2+1$, thus
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4})]=2$ and
    $[\mathbb{Q}(2^{-1/4},i):\mathbb{Q}]=4\cdot2=8$.
  \end{proof}
