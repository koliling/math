Section 3.5 Question 14:
Prove that the subgroup of $A_4$ generated by any element of order 2 and
any element of order 3 is all of $A_4$.
\begin{proof}
  Let $H\subset A_4$ be the subgroup generated by an element of order 2 and
  an element of order 3. Then by Lagrange's theorem $|H|$ must divide 2 and
  3. Also, because $H\leq A_4$, $|H|$ must divide $|A_4|=12$, so if $H\neq
  A_4$, $H$ must have exactly six elements. Then $|A_4:H|=2$, so $H$ must
  be a normal subgroup of $A_4$. \\

  We show that as a result, $H$ must contain all three-cycles. Assume by
  contradiction that there is a three-cycle $\sigma$ not in $H$. Since the
  only left cosets of $H$ are $H$ and $\sigma H$, so $\sigma^2H$ must be
  one of these cosets. If $\sigma^2H=H$, then $\sigma^2\in H$, which
  implies $\sigma^{-1}=\sigma^2\in H$, which implies $\sigma\in H$, a
  contradiction. On the other hand, if $\sigma^2H=\sigma H$, then $\sigma
  H=H$, which implies $\sigma\in H$, again a contradiction. Hence $H$ must
  contain all three-cycles. \\

  Yet, there are 8 three-cycles in $A_4$, but the order of $H$ is only 6, a
  contradiction.
\end{proof}
