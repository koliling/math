Section 4.2 Question 5: Let $r$ and $s$ be the usual generators for the
dihedral group of order 8 and let $H=\langle s\rangle$. List the left
cosets of $H$ in $D_8$ as $1H$, $rH$, $r^2H$, and $r^3H$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Label these cosests with the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
    Exhibit the image of each element of $D_8$ under the representation
    $\pi_H$ of $D_8$ into $S_4$ obtained from the action of $D_8$ b left
    multiplication on the set of 4 left cosets of $H$ in $D_8$. Deduce that
    this representation is faithful.
    \begin{proof}
      Under the given representation, $\pi_H$ can be summarized in the
      following table:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
          \hline
          $g\in D_8$ & $\pi_H(g)\in S_4$ \\
          \hline\hline
          $1$     & $(1)$ \\
          $r$     & $(1234)$ \\
          $r^2$   & $(13)(24)$ \\
          $r^3$   & $(1432)$ \\
          $s$     & $(24)$ \\
          $sr$    & $(14)(23)$ \\
          $sr^2$  & $(13)$ \\
          $sr^3$  & $(12)(34)$ \\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      The map $\pi_H:D_8\rightarrow S_4$ is a homomorphism, so its
      image is a subgroup of $S_4$. From the table, the kernel of this
      map contains only the identity, which implies that $\pi_H$ is
      injective, the representation is faithful, and $\pi_H(D_8)$ is
      isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_4$.
    \end{proof}
  \item Repeat part (a) with the list of cosets relabelled by the integers
    1, 3, 2, and 4 respectively. Show that the permutations obtaiend from
    this relabelling form a subgroup of $S_4$ that is different from the
    subgroup obtained in part (a).
    \begin{proof}
      Let $\pi_H'$ be the representation after relabelling. Since
      relabelling swaps 2 and 3, we have the following relation between
      $\pi_H$ and $\pi_H'$:
      \begin{align*}
        \pi_H'(g) &= (23)\pi_H(g)(23)^{-1} \\
                  &= (23)\pi_H(g)(23).
      \end{align*}
      Hence from the above table for $\pi_H$ we obtain the following
      table for $\pi_H'$:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
          \hline
          $g\in D_8$ & $\pi_H'(g)\in S_4$ \\
          \hline\hline
          $1$     & $(1)$ \\
          $r$     & $(1324)$ \\
          $r^2$   & $(12)(34)$ \\
          $r^3$   & $(1423)$ \\
          $s$     & $(34)$ \\
          $sr$    & $(14)(23)$ \\
          $sr^2$  & $(12)$ \\
          $sr^3$  & $(13)(24)$ \\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
    The subgroup $\pi_H'$ is different from $\pi_H$ since
    $(12)\in Im(\pi_H')$ but $(12)\not\in Im(\pi_H)$.
    \end{proof}
  \item Let $K=\langle sr\rangle$, list the cosets of $K$ in $D_8$ as $1K$,
    $rK$, $r^2K$, and $r^3K$, and label these with inteers 1, 2, 3, 4.
    Prove that, with respect to this labelling, the image of $D_8$ under
    the representation $\pi_K$ obtained from left multiplication on the
    cosets of $K$ is the same subgroup of $S_4$ as in part (a).
    \begin{proof}
      Note that since $(sr)^2=1$, we have $K=\{1,sr\}$. Under the given
      representation, $\pi_K$ can be summarized in the following table:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
          \hline
          $g\in D_8$ & $\pi_K(g)\in S_4$ \\
          \hline\hline
          $1$     & $(1)$ \\
          $r$     & $(1234)$ \\
          $r^2$   & $(13)(24)$ \\
          $r^3$   & $(1432)$ \\
          $s$     & $(12)(34)$ \\
          $sr$    & $(24)$ \\
          $sr^2$  & $(14)(23)$ \\
          $sr^3$  & $(24)(13)$ \\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      From this table, we can see that the subgroup $\pi_K(D_8)$ is the
      same as $\pi_H(D8)$.
    \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
