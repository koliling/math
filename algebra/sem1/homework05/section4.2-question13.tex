Section 4.2 Question 13
Prove that if $|G|=2k$ where $k$ is odd then $G$ has a subgroup of index 2.

\begin{proof}
  By Question 31 of Section 1.1, $G$ has an element of order 2. Then by
  Question 11 of Section 4.2, in the left regular representation
  $\pi:G\rightarrow S_G$, the image of $\pi$ contains an odd permutation.
  Then by Question 12 of Section 4.2, $G$ will have a subgroup of index 2,
  as we are required to show.
\end{proof}
