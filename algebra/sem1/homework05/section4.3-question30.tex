Section 4.3 Question 30:
If $G$ is a group of odd order, prove for any nonidentity element $x\in G$
that $x$ and $x^{-1}$ are not conjugate in $G$.

\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a group of odd order with a nonidentity element $x\in G$ whose
  inverse is conjugate with itself. Let $\kappa(x)$ be the conjugancy class
  of $x$. We first show that $\kappa(x)$ is closed under inverses. Given
  $y\in\kappa(x)$, we have $y=gxg^{-1}$ for some $g\in G$. Then
  $y^{-1}=gx^{-1}g^{-1}$, which will also be in $\kappa(x)$ because
  $x^{-1}$ is in $\kappa(x)$. Hence $\kappa(x)$ is closed under inverses.
  \\
  
  Now given any nonidentity element $g\in G$, the order of $g$ cannot be
  two otherwise $\{1,g\}$ will be a subgroup of $G$, which would contradict
  the order of the group since order of subgroups must divide the order of
  the whole group. \\
  
  Hence each element $y$ in $\kappa(x)$ can be paired with its inverse
  $y^{-1}$ also in $\kappa(x)$ and distinct from $y$, and since $\kappa(x)$
  is finite, $\kappa(x)$ must have an even number of elements. But from
  Proposition 6 of Section 4.3, the order of $\kappa(x)$ should divide the
  order of $G$, which would contradict that $G$ has odd order.
\end{proof}
