Section 4.5 Question 3: Use Sylow's Theorem to prove Cauchy's Theorem.

\begin{proof}
  Let $p$ be a prime dividing the order of a group $G$. By Sylow theorems,
  a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ exists. Pick any non-identity element $g$ in
  $P$. By Lagrange's theorem, $g$ must have order $p^k$ for some
  $k\in\mathbb{N}^+$. If $k=1$, then we are done. Otherwise the element
  $g^{p^{k-1}}$ will have order $p$.
\end{proof}
