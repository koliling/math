Section 4.5 Question 20: Prove that if $|G|=1365$ then $G$ is not simple.

\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a group of order $1365=3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot13$. Consider
  $n_{13}$. From Theorem 18.3 of Section 4.5, $n_{13}$ must divide
  $3\cdot5\cdot7$, and must also equal 1 modulo 13. Hence $n_{13}$ can
  only be 1. Then from Corollary 20 of Section 4.5, the only Sylow
  13-subgroup of $G$ is normal, hence $G$ is not simple.
\end{proof}
