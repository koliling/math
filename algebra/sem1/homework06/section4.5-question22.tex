Section 4.5 Question 22: Prove that if $|G|=132$ then $G$ is not simple.

\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a group of order $132=2^2\cdot3\cdot11$. By the Sylow
  Theorems, we have $n_{11}\in\{1,12\}$, $n_3\in\{1,4,22\}$, and
  $n_2\in\{1,3,11,33\}$. If $G$ is simple, then $n_{11}=12$, $n_3\geq4$,
  and $n_2\geq 3$. \\

  From $n_{11}=12$, we get at least $12\times(11-1)=120$ elements of order
  11. From $n_{3}\geq4$, we get at least $4\times(3-1)=8$ elements of
  order 3. From $n_{2}>2$, we get at least $3+2=5$ elements of
  order dividing 4. Adding these we get at least $120+8+5=132$ non-identity
  elements, a contradiction.
\end{proof}
