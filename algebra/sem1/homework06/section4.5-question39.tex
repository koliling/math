Section 4.5 Question 39: Show that the subgroup of strictly upper
triangular matrices in $\text{GL}(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of
this finite group.

\begin{proof}
  From the order formula in Section 1.4, we have
  \begin{align*}
    |\text{GL}(\mathbb{F}_p)| &= (p^n-1)(p^n-p)\ldots(p^n-p^{n-1}). \\
  \end{align*}
  Hence the order of the Sylow $p$-subgroups should be
  \begin{align*}
    p^{1+2+\ldots+(n-1)}.
  \end{align*}
  Since this is the same as the order of the subgroup of strictly upper
  triangular matrices, this subgroup is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of
  $\text{GL}(\mathbb{F}_p)$.
\end{proof}
