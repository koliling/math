\begin{enumerate}[label={\bf Q\arabic*:}]
  \item \it A tree $T$ is a set of finite strings of 0 and 1 and closed
    under initial segments, $\prec$. So $T\subseteq2^{<\omega}$. If
    $f\in2^\omega$ and, for all $n$, $f\restriction n\in T$, then $f$ is a
    path through $T$ and $f\in[T]$. A path $p$ is isolated in $T$ if and
    only if there is a $\sigma\in2^{<\omega}$ such that $\{p\}=[\tau\in
    T:\sigma\preceq\tau\; \text{or}\; \tau\preceq\sigma]$. Assume that $T$
    is computable. Show that all isolated paths of $T$ are computable. Show
    that if $[T]$ is finite then all paths are isolated.

    \begin{proof}
      Let $p$ be an isolated path of a computable tree $T$ as described in
      the question, with $\sigma\in T$ witnessing the isolation. Let
      $\tau\in2^{<\omega}$. To decide if $\tau$ lies in $p$, we first check
      if $\tau\in T$. Next, we check if $\tau$ is comparable with
      $\sigma$. If either of these two conditions fail, then $\tau$ is not
      in $p$. Otherwise, if $\tau$ is an initial segment of $\sigma$, then
      $\tau$ is definitely in $p$. \\

      But if $\tau$ strictly extends $\sigma$, we need to check for one
      more condition to decide if $\tau$ lies on $p$. We check by induction
      on the length of $\tau$. Assume without loss of generality that
      $|\tau|=n+1$, where $n\geq|\sigma|$. We can also assume that
      $\tau(n)=0$. Then $\tau\in p$ if and only if $\tau\restriction n\in
      p$ and $(\tau\restriction n)^\frown1 \not\in p$, where $^\frown$
      denotes concatenation. The second condition follows because $p$ is
      isolated. We can check for the first condition recursively on the
      length of the $\tau$, where the base case $|\tau|=|\sigma|$ gives
      $\tau\in p$ if and only if $\tau=\sigma$. To check for the second
      condition, note that from the isolation of $p$, exactly one of the
      subtrees $T_{(\tau\restriction n)^\frown0}$ or $T_{(\tau\restriction
      n)^\frown1}$ contains a path. Furthermore, from Konig's lemma, the
      subtree that does not contain a path must be finite. Thus, letting
      $T_k$ denote the complete binary tree of length $k\in\omega$, there
      exists some large $k\in\omega$ such that either of
      $T_{(\tau\restriction n)^\frown0}$ is contained in $\tau\restriction
      n^\frown0^\frown T_k$, or $T_{(\tau\restriction n)^\frown1}$ is
      contained in $\tau\restriction n^\frown1^\frown T_k$. Note that
      deciding if $T_{(\tau\restriction n)^\frown i}$ is contained in
      $\tau\restriction n^\frown i^\frown T_k$ is computable because $T$ is
      computable. Thus if $T_{(\tau\restriction n)^\frown1}$ is contained
      in $\tau\restriction n^\frown1^\frown T_k$ for some large enough
      $k\in\omega$, then we know $\tau\in p$. On the other hand, if
      $T_{(\tau\restriction n)^\frown0}$ is contained in $\tau\restriction
      n^\frown0^\frown T_k$ for some large enough $k\in\omega$, then
      $\tau\not\in p$. \\

      Observe that all checks we performed to determine if $\tau\in p$ are
      algorithmic in nature: checking if $\tau\in T$ is algorithmic since
      $T$ is computable; checking if $\tau$ is an initial segment or an
      extension of $\sigma$ is also algorithmic since $\sigma$ and $\tau$
      are finite in length; checking if $p$ extends $\tau$ as described in
      the previous paragraph is also recursive in nature and thus
      algorithmic. Thus by Church-Turing thesis, $p$ is computable. \\

      Assume $T$ contains a path $p$ that is not isolated. Then we can find
      countably infinite distinct paths $\{q_n:n\in\omega\}$ in $T$
      different from $p$ as follows: Staring at $n=0$, since the empty
      string does not isolate $p$, there must be a path $q_0\in T$ that is
      distinct from $p$. For $n+1$, let $\sigma_n\in2^{<\omega}$ denote the
      longest initial segment shared by $p$ and $q_n$. Note that $\sigma_n$
      exists since $p$ and $q_n$ are distinct. Also from construction,
      $|\sigma_n|$ is strictly increasing in $n$. Then let $q_{n+1}$ be a
      path in $T$ that extends $p\restriction(|\sigma_n|+1)$ and that is
      distinct from $p$. Such a $q_{n+1}$ must exist since $\sigma_n$ does
      not isolate $p$. Also, note $q_{n+1}$ will be distinct from
      $\{q_0,\ldots,q_n\}$ from construction. Thus $[T]$ is infinite.
