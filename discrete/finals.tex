\begin{enumerate}
  \item \it

  \item \it Let $T$ be a tree with $k$ edges.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and more than $(k-1)n$
        edges. Show that $G$ contains $T$ as a subgraph.

      \item Show that there are infinitely many $n$ for which there is a
        graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and at least $(k-1)n/2$ edges for which
        $G$ does not contain $T$ as a subgraph.

        \begin{proof}
          For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $k|n$, the graph consisting
          of $n/k$ copies of $K_k$, the complete graph on $k$ vertices,
          does not have $T$ as a subgraph, since there are not enough
          vertices on each $K_k$. The number of edges in such a graph is
          \[m =\binom{k}{2}\cdot\frac{n}{k} =(k-1)n/2.\]
          Since there are infinite $n$ which are multiples of $k$, there
          are infinite such $G$'s.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}
