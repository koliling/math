\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $X$ be a CW complex.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Prove that if $X$ has finitely may cells, then $X$ is compact.
        \begin{proof}
          We prove by induction on $n$, the number of cells of $X$. For the
          base case where $n=1$, $X$ is a single point, which is trivially
          compact. For the inductive step, assume the statement is true for
          $n$ cells, and consider the case when $X$ is composed of $(n+1)$
          cells. $X$ is obtained from gluing an $n$-disc $D^n$ to $X^{(n)}$
          at the boundary of the disk $\delta D^n$. $X^{(n)}$ is compact by
          inductive assumption. The $n$-disc is also compact since it is
          closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $X$ is a compact
          space attached to another compact space, it must also be compact
          - any open cover of $X$ must cover each of its component
          spaces, giving a finite cover from each component space by the
          compactness of those spaces.
        \end{proof}

      \item Let $C\subset X$ be a compact subset. Prove that $C$ only
        intersects finitely many cells of $X$.
        \begin{proof}
          Assume by contradiction that a compact subset $C$ intersects
          infinite number of cells of $X$. Let $\{e^i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$
          be a countably infinite series of distinct cells that intersect
          with $C$. From each cell $e^i$, we pick a point $x_i\in X$ from
          their area of intersection, to obtain a series $P=\{x_0,\ldots\}$
          of points in $X$. \\

          We first prove by induction that $P$ is closed in $X$. By
          definition, this is equivalent to proving that $P\cap X^{(n)}$ is
          closed in $X^{(n)}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$. We prove this
          claim by induction on $n$: The base case is trivially true since
          it consists $P\cap X^{(0)}$ consists of only one point $x_0$.
          Assume the claim is true for $n$. Then $\varphi_{n+1}^{-1}(P)$ is
          closed in the disk boundary $\delta D^{n+1}$, so after adding one
          more point $x_{n+1}$ into $D^{n+1}$, $\varphi_{n+1}^{-1}(P)$ will
          remain closed in $D^{n+1}$, implying that $P\cap X^{n+1}$ is
          closed in $X^{n+1}$. \\

          By similar argument, any subset of $P$ must also be closed in
          $X$, which means that $P$ as a subset of $X$ has the discrete
          topology. Yet, $P$ is infinite, so it cannot be compact, which is
          a contradiction because $P$ is a closed subset of a compact space
          $C$, and should be compact.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Construct CW complex structures on the following spaces.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item An $n$-dimensional torus.
        \begin{proof}
          An $n$-torus is formed by first creating an $n$-dimensional cube,
          then gluing opposing faces of the cube together. We observe the
          pattern of number cells needed as $n$ increases from 0 to 2. The
          0-torus is a single 0-cell. The 1-torus is a 0-cell, glued with a
          1-cell. The 2-torus is a 0-cell, glued with two 1-cells, then
          with a 2-cell on the two one-cells. So the $n$-cell is obtained
          by starting with a 0-cell, then gluing $n$ 1-cells to the 0-cell,
          where the end points of each 1-cell is glued to the 0-cell,
          forming a flower with $n$ petals. To complete the $n$-cell, we
          build a $(n-1)$-torus over each $\binom{n}{n-1}$ choice of
          $(n-1)$ petals, reusing any $(n-i)$ cells that have been built
          earlier. \\

          This system of construction can be summarized as follows
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Start with a single 0-cell.
            \item Glue $n$ 1-cells to the 0-cell, sticking the end points
              of each 1-cell to the 0-cell, forming a flower with $n$
              petals.
            \item Repeat for $i=2$ to $n$: Between every $i$
              1-cells, glue an $i$-cell to the $i$ $(i-1)$-cells
              constructed in the earlier stage, such that opposing faces of
              the $i$-cell are glued to the same $(i-1)$-cell, and each
              $(i-1)$-cell has exactly two $i$-cell faces glued onto them.
          \end{enumerate}

          From construction, we summarize that an $n$-torus is built from
          $\binom{n}{i}$ $i$-cells, for $0\leq i\leq n$. \\
        \end{proof}

      \item Letting $\{p_1,\ldots,p_n\}$ be $n$ distinct points on $S^2$,
        the quotient space of $S^2$ that identifies all the $p_i$ to a
        single point.

        \begin{proof}
          After visualizing, we realize that the quotient space of
          $S^2$ is constructed using one 0-cell, $(n-1)$ 1-cells, and one
          2-cell, in the following manner:
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Start with a 0-cell, which is a single point.
            \item Glue the $(n-1)$ 1-cells to the 0-cell, sticking the end
              points of each 1-cell to the 0-cell, forming a flower with
              $(n-1)$ petals labelled $a_1$ to $a_{n-1}$, as shown in the
              left figure below.
            \item Partition the boundary of the 2-cell into $2(n-1)$ parts,
              label and direct the parts as shown in the right figure
              below. Then, glue the 2-cell onto the petals of the flower
              according to the labels, sending each of the marked dots to
              the 0-cell.
          \end{enumerate}

  \item Carefully prove that the following are covering spaces.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The map $\pi:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^*$ defined by
            $\pi(z)=e^z$. \label{qn:exp}

            \begin{proof}
              First, we observe that the function is holomorphic, and hence
              is open and continuous by the open mapping theorem. Also,
              given any $y\in\mathbb{C}^*$, the inverse $z=\ln(y)$ always
              exists, and $\pi(z_1)=\pi(z_2)\leftrightarrow z_1-z_2\in
              2\pi\mathbb{Z}$. Hence, the map when restricted to any open
              subset of the horizontal strip $\mathbb{R}\times[z-\pi
              i,z+\pi i)\subset\mathbb{C}^*$, where $z\in\mathbb{C}$, will
              be a homeomorphism when the codomain is the image of the
              subset.  We use these properties to show that given any
              $y\in\mathbb{C}^*$, there is an open set $\mathcal{O}$
              containing $y$ such that its pre-image is composed of
              disjoint open sets each of which is homeomorphic to
              $\mathcal{O}$. \\

              Given $y\in\mathbb{C}^*$, choose any $z\in\mathbb{C}$ in
              its pre-image, and let $\mathcal{U}\in\mathbb{C}$ be an open
              ball $B_r(z)$ of radius $0<r<0.5$ around $z$. Let $\mathcal{O}$
              be the the image of $\mathcal{U}$ under $\pi$; this image
              will contain $y$ and is open because $\pi$ is an open
              function. Consider the restriction of $\pi$ to the open ball
              $\mathcal{U}$. Since the diameter of $\mathcal{U}$ is less
              than 1, the map is injective. Hence, by the holomorphic
              property of $\pi$, $\mathcal{U}$ is homeomorphic to
              $\mathcal{O}$. Now the pre-image of $\mathcal{O}$ is the
              union of $2\pi ki$ translations of $\mathcal{U}$ for
              $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, or more precisely
              
              \begin{equation*}
                \pi^{-1}(\mathcal{O}) = \bigcup\limits_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}
                (\mathcal{U}+2k\pi i),
              \end{equation*}

              where each $\mathcal{U}+2\pi ki=\{x+2k\pi
              i:x\in\mathcal{U}\}$ is open, homeomorphic to
              $\mathcal{O}$, and pairwise disjoint, which completes the
              proof.
            \end{proof}

          \item For $n\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$, the map
            $\pi:\mathbb{C}^*\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^*$ defined by
            $\pi(z)=z^n$.

            \begin{proof}
              Similar to the proof in question~\ref{qn:exp}, observe that
              the map is holomorphic and is therefore open and continuous
              by the open mapping theorem. Also, given any
              $y\in\mathbb{C}^*$, the inverse $z=y^{1/n}$ always exists,
              and the pre-image of $y$ are the $n$ points
              $\pi^{-1}(y)=\{y^{1/n}\exp(2k\pi i/n):0\leq k<n\}$. Hence,
              the map when restricted to any open subset of sectors
              $\{z\in\mathbb{C}^*:\theta-\pi i/n<\arg(z)<\theta+\pi i/n\}$,
              where $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$, will be a homeomorphism when the
              codomain is the image of the subset. We use these properties
              to show that given any $y\in\mathbb{C}^*$, there is an open
              set $\mathcal{O}$ containing $y$ such that its pre-image is
              composed of disjoint open sets each of which is homeomorphic
              to $\mathcal{O}$. \\

              Given $y\in\mathbb{C}^*$, choose any $z\in\mathbb{C}$ in
              its pre-image, and let $\mathcal{U}\in\mathbb{C}$ be an open
              ball $B_\epsilon(z)$ around $z$ and contained in the sector
              $\{w\in\mathbb{C}^*:\arg(z)-\pi i/n<\arg(w)<\arg(z)+\pi
              i/n\}$. Such an open ball exists since the sector is open.
              Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the the image of $\mathcal{U}$ under
              $\pi$; this image will contain $y$ and is open because $\pi$
              is an open function. Consider the restriction of $\pi$ to the
              open ball $\mathcal{U}$. Since the difference in $\arg$
              between any two points in $\mathcal{U}$ is less than $2k\pi
              i/n$, the map is injective. Hence, by the holomorphic
              property of $\pi$, $\mathcal{U}$ is homeomorphic to
              $\mathcal{O}$. Now the pre-image of $\mathcal{O}$ is the
              union of $n$ rotations of $\mathcal{U}$ by $2k\pi i/n$
              degrees for $0\leq k<n$, or more precisely

              \begin{equation*}
                \pi^{-1}(\mathcal{O}) = \bigcup\limits_{k=0}^{n-1}
                \mathcal{U}\exp(2k\pi i/n),
              \end{equation*}

              where each $\mathcal{U}\exp(2k\pi i/n)=\{x\exp(2k\pi
              i/n):x\in\mathcal{U}\}$ is open, homeomorphic to
              $\mathcal{O}$, and pairwise disjoint, which completes
              the proof.
            \end{proof}
        \end{enumerate}

      \item Prove that the map $\pi:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$
        defined by $\pi(z)=z^2$ is not a covering space.

        \begin{proof}
          If $\pi$ is a covering space, then given any $z\in\mathbb{C}$ and
          open set $\mathcal{O}$ containing $z$, the cardinality of the
          pre-image of each element in $\mathcal{O}$ should be the same.
          However at $z=0$ and given any open ball $B_\epsilon(0)$ around
          $z$, we have $|\pi^{-1}(0)|=|\{0\}|=1$, but
          $|\pi^{-1}(\epsilon/2)|=|\{-\sqrt{\epsilon/2},\sqrt{\epsilon/2}\}|=2$,
          so $\pi$ cannot be a covering space.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Let $\pi:\tilde{X}\rightarrow X$ be a covering space such that
    $\pi^{-1}(p)$ is finite and nonempty for all $p\in X$. Prove that $X$ is
    compact Hausdorff if and only if $\tilde{X}$ is compact Hausdorff.

    \begin{proof}
      We first prove the forward implication. Assume that $X$ is compact
      Hausdorff. We show that $(\tilde{X})$ is Hausdorff. Let
      $\tilde{x_1},\tilde{x_2}$ be two points in $\tilde{X}$. There are two
      cases to consider. In the first case, $\tilde{x_1}$ and $\tilde{x_2}$
      are mapped to distinct points $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively. Then from
      the Hausdorff property of $\tilde{X}$, there are disjoint open sets
      $\mathcal{O}_1$ and $\mathcal{O}_2$ containing $x_1$ and $x_2$
      respectively. From continuity of $\pi$, the pre-images of
      $\mathcal{O}_1$ and $\mathcal{O}_2$ are open. The pre-images contain
      $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, and by construction, must be disjoint.
      Hence $\tilde{X}$ is also Hausdorff. In the second case,
      $\tilde{x_1}$ and $\tilde{x_2}$ are mapped to the same image $x\in
      X$. Since $\pi$ is a covering space, there must exist an open set
      $\mathcal{O}$ containing $x$ such that the pre-image of $\mathcal{O}$
      is a union of disjoint open sets each homeomorphic to $\mathcal{O}$
      by the restriction of $\pi$. Then $\tilde{x_1}$ and $\tilde{x_2}$
      must be contained in distinct open sets of the pre-image, since $\pi$
      restricted to each open set is a bijection. So we have shown that in
      all cases, $\tilde{X}$ is Hausdorff. \\

      Now we show that $\tilde{X}$ is compact. Let $\{\mathcal{O_i}\}_{i\in
      I}$ be an infinite open cover of $\tilde{X}$. \TODO{Show
      compactness.}

      Next we prove the converse of the claim. Assume that $\tilde(X)$ is
      compact Hausdorff. We first show that $X$ is compact. Let
      $\{\mathcal{O_i}\}_{i\in I}$ be an infinite open cover of $X$. By
      continuity and surjectivity of $\pi$, $\{\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{O}_i)\}_{i\in
      I}$ will be an open cover of $\tilde{X}$. Then by compactness of
      $\tilde{X}$, there exists a finite set of covers
      $\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{O}_1),\ldots,\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{O}_k)$ that covers
      $\tilde{X}$. Then the finite set $\mathcal{O_1},\ldots,\mathcal{O_k}$
      will cover $X$, implying that $X$ is compact. \\

      Finally, we show that $X$ is Hausdorff. Let $x_1$, $x_2$ be two
      distinct points in $X$. Let $\mathcal{O}_1$, $\mathcal{O}_2$ be open
      sets containing $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively given by the covering
      space property of $\pi$. For $i=1,2$, let
      $\mathcal{U}_i\subseteq\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{O}_i)$ be one of the open
      sets of $\tilde{X}$ that is homeomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_i$ under the
      restriction map of $\pi$. Let $\tilde{x_i}\in\mathcal{U}_i$ be the
      pre-image of $x_i$. Then $\tilde{x_1}$ and $\tilde{x_2}$ are
      distinct, by Hausdorff property of $\tilde{X}$, must be contained in
      disjoint open sets $\mathcal{U}_1'$ and $\mathcal{U}_2'$
      respectively. For $i=1,2$, let
      $\mathcal{O}_i''=\pi(\mathcal{U}_i\cap\mathcal{U}_i')$. From
      homeomorphism of $\pi$ when restricted to $\mathcal{U}_i$,
      $\mathcal{O}_i'$ is an open set containing $x_i$. Also, from
      disjointness of $\mathcal{U}_0'$ and $\mathcal{U}_1'$,
      $\mathcal{O}_0'$ and $\mathcal{O}_1'$ must also be disjoint, which
      completes our proof that $X$ is Hausdorff.
    \end{proof}

  \item Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space and $G$ be a group acting on $X$.
    Assume the following two conditions hold. Prove that the action of $G$
    on $X$ is a covering space action.
