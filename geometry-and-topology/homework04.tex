\begin{enumerate}
  \item \begin{proof} We show by induction on $n$ that the fibers of
    $\cup_{k=1}^n\widetilde{X}^{i}$ can be endowed with the structure of a
    CW complex such that $f$ takes the interiors of the $k$-cells in the
    fibers homeomorphically to the interiors of $k$-cells in
    $\cup_{k=1}^n\widetilde{X}^{i}$. For $k=0$, the fiber of each
    $X^0_{\alpha}$ is a union of $0$-cells. These 0-cells are contained in
    disjoint sheets lying above a trivialized neighborhood of
    $X^0_{\alpha}$, and hence can be assigned the discrete topology in
    $\widetilde{X}$. \\

    For the inductive step $n+1$, consider the embedding
    $\varphi_\alpha:D^{n+1}\xhookrightarrow{}X$ which embeds an
    $(n+1)$-cell to $X^{n+1}$. This embedding glues the boundary
    $S^n\subset D^{n+1}$ onto $X^n$ and takes the interior of $D^{n+1}$ to
    the interior of an $(n+1)$-cell in $X^{n+1}$. Pick a point $x_0\in
    S^n\subset D^{n+1}$. The fiber of $\varphi_\alpha(x_0)$ is a union of
    points $\{\widetilde{x}_{0,\beta}\}_{\beta\in I}$ in $\widetilde{X}^n$,
    contained in disjoint sheets lying above the trivialized neighborhood
    of $\varphi_\alpha(x_0)$. Then for each $\widetilde{x}_{0,\beta}$,
    consider the lift of $\varphi_\alpha$ to $\widetilde{X}^{n+1}$ that
    sends $x_0$ to $\widetilde{x}_{0,\beta}$. By the lifting criterion,
    because $D^{n+1}$ is contractable, such a lift
    $\widetilde{\varphi_\alpha}$ exists. This lift will glue $D_{n+1}$ at
    the boundary to $\widetilde{X}^n$, forming $\widetilde{X}^{n+1}$, which
    completes the inductive step.
  \end{proof}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \begin{proof}
        The left to right implication is trivial by chasing definitions.
        For the converse, assume $Y_1^{(1)}\rightarrow X^{(1)}$ and
        $Y_2^{(1)}\rightarrow X^{(1)}$ are isomorphic. We prove by
        induction on $n$ that the restrictions $Y_1^{(n)}\rightarrow
        X^{(n)}$ and $Y_2^{(n)}\rightarrow X^{(n)}$ are isomorphic. The
        base case $n=1$ is true by assumption. \\

        For the inductive step $n+1$, consider the embedding
        $\varphi_\alpha:D^{n+1}\xhookrightarrow{}X$ which embeds an
        $(n+1)$-cell to $X^{(n+1)}$. This embedding glues the boundary
        $S^n\subset D^{n+1}$ onto $X^n$ and takes the interior of $D^{n+1}$
        to the interior of an $(n+1)$-cell in $X^{(n+1)}$. Pick a point
        $x\in S^n\subset D^{n+1}$. For each $Y_i$, $i\in\{1,2\}$, the fiber
        of $\varphi_\alpha(x)$ is a union of points
        $\{\widetilde{y}_{i,\beta}\}_{\beta\in J_i}$ in
        $\widetilde{Y_i}^{(n)}$, contained in disjoint sheets lying above
        the trivialized neighborhood of $\varphi_\alpha(x)$. By induction
        hypothesis, since $\widetilde{Y_1}^{(n)}$ and
        $\widetilde{Y_2}^{(n)}$ are isomorphic covers of $X^{(n)}$, the
        homeomorphism between $\widetilde{Y_1}^{(n)}$ and
        $\widetilde{Y_2}^{(n)}$ will induce a bijection between
        $\{\widetilde{y}_{1,\beta}\}_{\beta\in J_1}$ and
        $\{\widetilde{y}_{2,\beta}\}_{\beta\in J_2}$, so we can assume
        without loss of generality that $J_1=J_2=J$ and the homeomorphism
        maps $\widetilde{y}_{1,\beta}$ to $\widetilde{y}_{2,\beta}$. Then
        for each $\widetilde{y}_{i,\beta}$, consider the lift of
        $\varphi_\alpha$ to $\widetilde{Y_i}^{n+1}$ that sends $x$ to
        $\widetilde{y}_{i,\beta}$. By the lifting criterion, because
        $D^{n+1}$ is contractable, such a lift
        $\widetilde{\varphi_\alpha}$ exists. The image of each lift is a
        $(n+1)$-cell that is projected down to a $(n+1)$-cell in $X$. Also,
        the lift to $Y_1$ and the lift to $Y_2$ will be homeomorphic, which
        completes the inductive step.

        X^{(n)}$ is a regular covering space. The
