\begin{enumerate}[label={\bf Q\arabic*:}]
  \item

  \item Let $X$ be a connected graph with vertex set $V(X)$ and edge set
    $E(X)$. Assume that both $V(X)$ and $E(X)$ are finite sets.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If $X$ is a tree, prove that $|V(X)|-|E(X)|=1$.
        \begin{proof}
          A tree is defined as an undirected graph where every two vertices
          is connected by exactly one path. First we prove that in a
          connected and finite tree with more than one node, there exist a
          vertex with exactly one edge connected to it: Since the graph is
          connected with more than one node, all vertices must have at
          least one edge connected to it, otherwise the graph would be
          disconnected. Assume by contradiction that all vertices have at
          least two edges connected to it. Then by starting at any vertex,
          we trace a path in the tree by following one of the two edges
          that has not been traversed yet. Because the graph is finite, we
          will eventually traverse the same vertex twice, resulting in a
          cycle. This contradicts the fact that any two vertices are
          connected by exactly one path. \\

          Now we prove by induction on $|V(X)|$ that the assertion is true.
          Base cases $|V(X)|\leq 1$ is trivially true. Given a finite
          connected tree with $|V(X)|=n+1$, from the previous paragraph,
          we can find a vertex with exactly one edge. Removing that vertex
          gives a connected tree with $n$ vertices, so by induction
          hypothesis, that tree will have $n-1$ edges. Adding the
          vertex back again will give us a tree with $n+1$ vertices and
          $n$ edges, so the assertion still holds.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
