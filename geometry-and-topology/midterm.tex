  \item Let $T^2=S^1\times S^1$ be the 2-dimensional torus. Show that any
    map $f:S^2\rightarrow T^2$ is homotopic to a constant map.
    \begin{proof}
      Note that since $T^2$ is path-connected, locally path-connected, and
      semi-locally simply connected, it has a universal cover.
      $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a universal cover of $T^2$. Now since $S^2$ is
      simply connected, and $\mathbb{R}^2$ is contractible, $f$ will lift
      to a null-homotopic map $f^*:S^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$. Then since
      $f$ is the projection of $f^*$ down to $T^2$, $f$ will also be
      null-homotopic because $f^*$ is.
    \end{proof}

  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Let $x_1,\ldots,x_k\in S^2$ be distinct points and let $p\in
        S^2\setminus\{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}$ be a base point. Calculate a
        presentation for the group
        $\pi_1(S^2\setminus\{x_1,\ldots,x_k\},p)$.

        \begin{proof}
        \end{proof}

      \item Let $L_1,\ldots,L_k$ be distinct non-intersecting lines in
        $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $q\in\mathbb{R}^3\setminus(L_1\cup\ldots\cup
        L_k)$ be a base point. Calculate a presentation for the group
        $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^3\setminus(L_1\cup\ldots\cup L_k),q)$.

        \begin{proof}
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Let $X$ be a space. Define the suspension of $X$, denoted $\sum X$,
    to be the quotient of $X\times[0,1]$ that identifies $X\times\{0\}$ to
    a single point and $X\times\{1\}$ to a single point (these are two
    different points!). Fix a base point $p\in\sum X$. Prove that if $X$ is
    path-connected, then $\pi_1(\sum X,p)=1$. Give an example to show that
    path-connectedness is necessary. 

    \begin{proof}
      We apply van-Kampen's theorem. Fix base point associated with
      $p=(x_0,0.5)$ in $\sum X$ for any $x_0\in X$. Let
      $U_0=X\times[0,0.6)/\sim$ be the left side of $\sum X$ containing
      $X\times\{0\}$, and $U_1=X\times(0.4,1]/\sim$ be the right side of
      $\sum X$ containing $X\times\{1\}$. Then both $U_0$ and $U_1$ are
      path-connected by the path-connectedness of $X$, they form an open
      cover of $\sum X$, they both contain the base point, and their
      intersection $U_0\cap U_1$ is also path connected because of
      path-connectedness of $X$. So all conditions for van-Kampen's theorem
      are satisfied, and we can apply the theorem to compute the
      fundamental group of $\sum X=U_0\cup U_1$. \\

      Now each $U_i$ is contractible to the point $X\times\{i\}/\sim$ in
      $\sum X$, hence each $U_i$ has trivial fundamental group
      $1=\langle|\rangle$. Applying van-Kampen's theorem,
      \begin{align*}
        \pi_1(\sum X,p) &= \langle|\rangle / \pi_1(U_0\cap U_1,p) \\
                        &= \langle|\rangle \\
                        &= 1. \\
      \end{align*}
      Hence $\sum X$ has trivial fundamental group. \\

      Consider the example where $X$ comprises of two distinct points. Then
      $\sum X$ will be homeomorphic to $S^1$, which has fundamental group
      $\mathbb{Z}\neq 1$.
    \end{proof}

  \item Let $X$ be a path-connected Hausdorff space and let
    $f:\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X$ be a covering space with $\widetilde{X}$
    compact. Prove that $f:\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X$  is a
    finite-sheeted cover.

    \begin{proof}
      Assume by contradiction that $f$ is not finite-sheeted. Define an
      open cover $\mathcal{O}$ of $\widetilde{X}$ by the set of all sheets
      lying above each point $x$ in $X$, i.e.
      \begin{equation*}
        \mathcal{O} := \bigcup_{x\in X}
          \{\widetilde{U}_{\alpha,x}:\alpha\in A\}.
      \end{equation*}
      From compactness of $\widetilde{X}$, $\mathcal{O}$ contains a finite
      sub-cover $\mathcal{U}\subset\mathcal{O}$. Write $\mathcal{U}$ as
      \begin{equation*}
        \mathcal{U} := \bigcup_{i=1}^n \widetilde{U}_{\alpha_i,x_i}.
      \end{equation*}
      Consider the sheets of $x_1$. Each sheet $\widetilde{U}_{\alpha,x_1}$
      of $x_1$ must be contained in some sheet in $\mathcal{U}$, which
      implies that the degree of $x_1$ is at most $n$. Since the degree of
      a cover is independent on the choice of $x\in X$, $f$ must have
      degree no more than $n$, a contradiction.
    \end{proof}

  \item Using covering space theory, construct a free basis for the
    commutator subgroup $[F_2,F_2]$ of the free group $F_2$ on two
    generators $a$ and $b$.

    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}
