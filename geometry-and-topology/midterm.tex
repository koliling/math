  \item Let $T^2=S^1\times S^1$ be the 2-dimensional torus. Show that any
    map $f:S^2\rightarrow T^2$ is homotopic to a constant map.
    \begin{proof}
      Note that since $T^2$ is path-connected, locally path-connected, and
      semi-locally simply connected, it has a universal cover.
      $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a universal cover of $T^2$. Now since $S^2$ is
      simply connected, and $\mathbb{R}^2$ is contractible, $f$ will lift
      to a null-homotopic map $f^*:S^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$. Then since
      $f$ is the projection of $f^*$ down to $T^2$, $f$ will also be
      null-homotopic because $f^*$ is.
    \end{proof}

  \item Let $X$ be a path-connected Hausdorff space and let
    $f:\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X$ be a covering space with $\widetilde{X}$
    compact. Prove that $f:\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X$  is a
    finite-sheeted cover.

    \begin{proof}
      Assume by contradiction that $f$ is not finite-sheeted. Define an
      open cover $\mathcal{O}$ of $\widetilde{X}$ by the set of all sheets
      lying above each point $x$ in $X$, i.e.
      \begin{equation*}
        \mathcal{O} := \bigcup_{x\in X}
          \{\widetilde{U}_{\alpha,x}:\alpha\in A\}.
      \end{equation*}
      From compactness of $\widetilde{X}$, $\mathcal{O}$ contains a finite
      sub-cover $\mathcal{U}\subset\mathcal{O}$. Write $\mathcal{U}$ as
      \begin{equation*}
        \mathcal{U} := \bigcup_{i=1}^n \widetilde{U}_{\alpha_i,x_i}.
      \end{equation*}
      Consider the sheets of $x_1$. Each sheet $\widetilde{U}_{\alpha,x_1}$
      of $x_1$ must be contained in some sheet in $\mathcal{U}$, which
      implies that the degree of $x_1$ is at most $n$. Since the degree of
      a cover is independent on the choice of $x\in X$, $f$ must have
      degree no more than $n$, a contradiction.
    \end{proof}
