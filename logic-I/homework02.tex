  \item Prove Lemma 1.35: If $C$ is a non-empty set of cardinals then
    $\cup C$ is a cardinal.

    \begin{proof}
      Assume by contradiction that $\cup C$ is not a cardinal. 
      From Lemma 1.16.2, $\alpha=\cup C$ is an ordinal. By assumption
      hypothesis $|\alpha|=\lambda$ for some cardinal $\lambda\in\alpha$.
      Then $\lambda$ must be contained in some cardinal $\kappa\in C$.
      Since $\lambda$ and $\kappa$ are cardinals and $\kappa$ contains
      $\lambda$, $\kappa$ must be greater than $\lambda$ as cardinals. Now
      $\cup C$ is a superset of $\kappa$ since $\kappa$ is contained in
      $C$, implying that the cardinality of $\cup C$ is at least $\kappa$,
      a contradiction.
    \end{proof}

  \item Let $C=\{\kappa_i\,|\, i\in\omega\}$ be a set of cardinals such
    that $\kappa_i<\kappa_j$ for $i<j$. Let $\kappa=\cup C$. By the
    previous problem $\kappa$ is a cardinal. Show that $\kappa>\kappa_i$
    for all $i\in\omega$.

    \begin{proof}
      Given any $\kappa_i$, $\kappa$ is a superset of $\kappa_{i+1}$ and
      hence is at least as large as $\kappa_{i+1}$, which is larger than
      $\kappa_i$, as we are required to show.
    \end{proof}

  \item Show that the cardinality of the set
    \begin{equation*}
      \mathcal{S}=\{f\in\omega^\omega:\, \forall p\in\omega\; \forall
      n\in\omega\; (p<n\rightarrow f(p)<f(n))\}
    \end{equation*}
    equals $|2^\omega|$.

    \begin{proof}
      $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of monotonically increasing countable
      sequences of integers. Since $\mathcal{S}$ is a subset of
      $\omega^\omega$ which has cardinality $|2^\omega|$ from Corollary
      1.31, the cardinality of $\mathcal{S}$ must be smaller or equal to
      $|2^\omega|$. Hence it remains to show that $|\mathcal{S}|>\omega$.
      To prove that, it suffices to show that $\omega$ cannot enumerate
      $\mathcal{S}$. We prove this by using Cantor's diagonal argument.
      Assume that $\{f_i\}_{i\in\omega}$ enumerates $\mathcal{S}$. We
      inductively construct a new monotonically increasing function $f$
      that does not belong to any $f_i$'s, as follows: Set $f(0)=f_0(0)+1$.
      For each $n\in\omega$, set $f(n+1)=\max(f(n),f_n(n))+1$. By
      construction, $f$ cannot equal to any of the $f_i$'s in $\mathcal{S}$
      because $f(i)>f_i(i)$. Hence no countable enumeration of
      $\mathcal{S}$ exists.
    \end{proof}

  \item Show that the set
    \begin{equation*}
      \mathcal{S}=\{f\in\omega^\omega:\, \exists p\in\omega\; \forall
      n\in\omega\; (p<n\rightarrow f(p)=f(n))\}
    \end{equation*}
    is countable.

    \begin{proof}
      $\mathcal{S}$ is bijective to the set of all finite sequences of
      integers. Hence $\mathcal{S}$ has cardinality $\omega^{<\omega}$,
      which equals $\omega$ by Corollary 1.32.
    \end{proof}

  \item For given structures $\mathscr{M}$ and $\mathscr{N}$ decide if
    $\mathscr{M}$ can be embedded into $\mathscr{N}$. If it can, give an
    embedding; if not, explain why.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\mathscr{M}=\langle\mathbb{N},\leq,+,0\rangle$ and
        $\mathscr{N}=\langle\mathbb{N},\leq,\cdot,0\rangle$
        \begin{proof}
          No such embedding exists. Assume that an embedding
          $\alpha:\mathbb{N}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{N}$ exists. Then
          $\alpha(0)=0$ since embeddings preserve constants. Consider the
          image of $1$ under $\alpha$. Embeddings should preserve
          functions, so
          $\alpha(1)=\alpha(0+1)=\alpha(0)\cdot\alpha(1)=0\cdot\alpha(1)=0$.
          So $\alpha(0)=\alpha(1)=0$, contradicting the injectiveness of
          $\alpha$.
        \end{proof}

      \item $\mathscr{M}=\langle\mathbb{N},\leq,\cdot,0\rangle$ and
        $\mathscr{N}=\langle\mathbb{N},\leq,+,0\rangle$
        \begin{proof}
          No such embedding exists. Assume that an embedding
          $\alpha:\mathbb{N}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{N}$ exists. Then
          $\alpha(0)=0$ since embeddings preserve constants. Embeddings
          should also preserve functions, so
          $\alpha(0)=\alpha(0\cdot1)=\alpha(0)+\alpha(1)=0+\alpha(1)=\alpha(1)$,
          which contradicts the injectiveness of $\alpha$.
        \end{proof}

      \item $\mathscr{M}=\langle\mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\},\cdot,1\rangle$ and
        $\mathscr{N}=\langle\mathbb{N},+,0\rangle$
        \begin{proof}
          No such embedding exists. Assume that an embedding
          $\alpha:\mathbb{N}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{N}$ exists. Since
          embeddings preserve function maps, we can prove by induction on
          $k$ that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\}$,
          $\alpha(n^k)=k\cdot \alpha(n)$.  Let $m=\alpha(2)$ and
          $n=\alpha(3)$. Note that $m\neq0$ and $n\neq0$ since
          $\alpha(1)=0$ and $\alpha$ is injective. Then $\alpha(2^n)=n\cdot
          m=m\cdot n=\alpha(3^m)$, yet $2^n\neq3^m$ since $m,n\neq0$,
          contradicting the injectiveness of $\alpha$.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Give an example of two structures $\mathscr{M}$ and $\mathscr{N}$
    such that $\mathscr{M}$ is embeddable into $\mathscr{N}$, $\mathscr{N}$
    is embeddable into $\mathscr{M}$, but $\mathscr{M}$ is not isomorphic
    to $\mathscr{N}$.
