\begin{frame}{Bi-Hyperimmune sets}
  \begin{define}[Hyperimmune, Bi-hyperimmune]
    $A\subseteq\omega$ is \textbf{hyperimmune} if there is no effective way
    of knowing when new elements of $A$ have appeared.  Formally, no
    recursive function dominates $p_A$, the principal function of $A$. $A$
    is \textbf{bi-hyperimmune} if both $A$ and $\bar{A}$ are hyperimmune.
  \end{define}

  \begin{thm}
    Bi-hyperimmune sets exist.
  \end{thm}

  \textbf{Pf:} Enumerate recursive functions $f_0,f_1,\ldots$. At stage
  $s$, let $i$ be the number of elements in $A$ and $\bar{A}$ that has been
  defined so far. Put enough elements into $\bar{A}$ till the $(i+1)$-th
  element of $A$ exceeds that of $f_s$, then put the next element into $A$.
  This ensures that $f_s$ cannot tell when the $(i+1)$-th element of $A$
  has appeared. Repeat with roles of $A$ and $\bar{A}$ reversed.

\begin{frame}{Class of sets computing subsets of hyperimmune is null}
  \begin{thm}
    \label{thm:bihyper-null}
    Given a hyperimmune set $A$, the class of sets that can compute an
    infinite subset of $A$ is null.
  \end{thm}

  \vspace{1em}
  \textbf{Pf:} The idea is, assuming by contradiction the measure is
  positive, then there are enough paths computing subsets of $A$ that we
  can effectively get them to ``vote'' for when new elements of $A$
  have appeared, contradicting hyperimmunity of $A$.

  \vspace{1em}
  Since there are only countably many Turing functionals, and the union of
  countably many null sets is null, it suffices to show $\{X:
  \Gamma^X\in[A]^\omega\}$ is null, where
  $\Gamma:2^\omega\rightarrow2^\omega$ is a fixed Turing functional.
  Write $\mathcal{B} :=\{X: \Gamma^X\in[A]^\omega\}$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Class of sets computing subsets of hyperimmune is null}
  Assume by contradiction $\mu(\mathcal{B})=4m>0$.  Tightly approximate
  $\mathcal{B}$ by open cover $\mathcal{O}\supseteq\mathcal{B}$ with
  $\mu(\mathcal{O}-\mathcal{B})<m$, then again tightly approximate
  $\mathcal{O}$ by $[\sigma_0],\ldots,[\sigma_n] \subseteq\mathcal{O}$ with
  \[\mu(\mathcal{O}-([\sigma_0]\cup\ldots\cup[\sigma_n])) <m.\]

  Assume the $(s-1)$-th element of $A$ has been found to be below $k$. To
  find an interval in which the $s$-th element of $A$ falls below,
  enumerate the branches $\sigma$ in $[\sigma_0]\cup\ldots\cup[\sigma_n]$.
  Wait till a measure of $2m$ of them vote to have found (via
  $\Gamma$) an element larger than $k$. The $s$-th element of
  $A$ must be below the largest element found: Because
  $[\sigma_0]\cup\ldots\cup[\sigma_n]$ tightly approximates the class of
  paths computing infinite subsets of $A$,
  \begin{align*}
    &\mu(\text{``true'' infinite subset-computers})>2m,\\
    &\mu(\text{``false'' infinite subset-computers in }[\sigma_0]\cup\ldots\cup[\sigma_n])<2m. \blacksquare
  \end{align*}

  \begin{thm}
    $\text{RT}_2^1$ $\nleq_{\text{soc}}$ WWKL.
  \end{thm}

  \vspace{1em}
  \textbf{Pf:} Let $c:\omega\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ be a 2-coloring of the
  graph of a fixed bi-hyperimmune $A$, that is,
  \[c(n)=0 \Leftrightarrow n\in A.\]
  
  From bi-hyperimmunity of $A$, the class of sets computing an infinite
  subset of $A$ or of $\bar{A}$ is null. Equivalently, the class of
  $c$-homogeneous sets is null. Therefore given arbitrary tree
  $T\subseteq\omega^{<\omega}$ of positive measure, some path must fail to
  compute any $c$-homogeneous set. $\blacksquare$
