\begin{frame}{Notations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\omega=\mathbb{N}$, $a,b,\ldots\in\omega$,
      $A,B,\ldots\subseteq\omega$, $\sigma,\tau\in\omega^{<\omega}$,
      $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B},\ldots\subseteq\omega^\omega$.
    \item Trees $T$ are subsets of $\omega^{<\omega}$ closed under initial
      segments; i.e. $\sigma^{\frown}n\in T \rightarrow \sigma\in T$.
    \item Paths are functions $f:\omega\rightarrow\omega$. A tree contains
      a path $f$ iff $T$ contains every initial segment $f\restriction n$
      of $f$.
    \item $[T] :=\{f:f\; \text{is a path in}\; T\}$, $[\sigma]:=\{f:f\;
      \text{is a path containing}\; \sigma\}$.
    \item Turing functionals on trees are partial-recursive functionals
      $\Gamma:2^{<\omega}\rightarrow\omega^{<\omega}$ where
      $\tau\in\Gamma^{\sigma^\frown n} \rightarrow
      \tau\in\Gamma^{\sigma}$. $\Gamma$ can be extended naturally to
      $\Gamma:2^\omega\rightarrow\omega^{\omega}$.
    \item Given set $A$ and cardinal $\kappa$, $[A]^\kappa
      :=\{B\subseteq A: |B|=\kappa\}$.
    \item Given $A\in[\omega]^\omega$, can think of $A$ as its characteristic
      function $c_A:\omega\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, or as their principal
      function $p_A:\omega\rightarrow\omega$ which is a strictly increasing
      function enumerating $A$.

\begin{frame}{Ramsey's Theorem ($\text{RT}$)}
  \begin{define*}[$c$-homogeneous]
    Given $k$-coloring $c:[\omega]^n\rightarrow k$, a subset
    $A\subseteq\omega$ is $c$-homogeneous if every $n$-tuple over $A$ is
    given the same color by $c$.
  \end{define*}

  \vspace{1em}
  \begin{thm*}[Ramsey's Theorem]
    Fix $n,k\leq1$. $\text{RT}_k^n$ is the statement\\
    ``Every $k$-coloring $c:[\omega]^n\rightarrow k$ has an infinite
    $c$-homogeneous set.''\\
    RT is the statement $(\forall n)(\forall k)\; \text{RT}_k^n$.
  \end{thm*}

  \vspace{1em}
  RT asserts homogeneity exists.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Randomness}
  Intuitively, a path $f\in2^\omega$ is random if it cannot be ``caught''
  by a descending series of sub-trees $T\subseteq2^{<\omega}$, because
  these trees reveal information on the sequences caught by all of them. A
  series of trees is eligible to judge for randomness only if it shrinks
  fast enough for the set of paths caught in all of them to be ``sparse'';
  if too many paths are caught the information on them is not useful.

  \vspace{1em}
  One way of formalizing the notion of a tree that is not sparse is:
  \begin{define*}
    A (measurable) binary tree $T\subseteq2^{<\omega}$ has positive measure
    if
    \[\lim_s \frac{|\{\sigma\in T: |\sigma|=s\}|}{2^s} >0.\]
  \end{define*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{WWKL asserts Randomness}
  A series of sub-trees $T_0\subseteq T_1\subseteq\ldots$ is eligible to
  test for randomness if the limit of their measures is 0. Since there are
  only countably many Turing machines that can give randomness tests,
  and the class of non-randoms from each test has measure 0, and the
  measure of a countable union of (measurable) classes of measure 0 is
  still 0, the class of non-randoms has measure 0.

  \vspace{2em}
  Thus if a (measurable) tree has positive measure, it must contain a
  random. Weak Weak Konig's Lemma (WWKL) asserts that at least one of its
  paths is random by stating
  \begin{thm*}[Weak Weak Konig's Lemma]
    Every binary tree with positive measure contains a path.
  \end{thm*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{WWKL, WKL, KL}
  The paths of an instance of Weak Konig's Lemma (WKL), however, may
  all be non-randoms, because WKL instances allow for binary trees with
  measure 0, by stating
  \begin{thm*}[Weak Konig's Lemma]
    Every binary tree with infinite nodes contains a path.
  \end{thm*}

  \vspace{2em}
  Konig's Lemma claims more, asserting that paths for non-binary
  trees also exist if they are finitely branching: 
  \begin{thm*}[Konig's Lemma]
    Every finitely-branching tree with infinite nodes contains a path.
  \end{thm*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Homogeneity versus Randomness}
  A natural question to ask is which of the statements RT, KL, WKL, WWKL is
  stronger. Intuitively, WKL is stronger than WWKL, because a binary tree
  of positive measure has infinite nodes, so if all binary trees with
  infinite nodes have a path, then all binary trees with positive measure
  have one too. A more interesting question is
  \newtheorem*{question*}{Question}
  \begin{question*}
    Which notion is stronger, homogeneity or randomness?
  \end{question*}
  If a given a path is homogeneous, does that say anything about how random
  it is? Likewise, if a given path is random, can we use it to find
  homogeneous paths?

  \vspace{0.5em}
  Since the notions of homogeneity and randomness are captured by RT and
  WWKL respectively, we are essentially asking which of RT and WWKL is
  stronger.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem, Instance, Solution}
  We formalize the notion of problems and the strength between them.

  \vspace{1em}
  \begin{define*}[Problem, instance, solution]
    A mathematical \textbf{problem} is a collection of \textbf{instances},
    with a collection of \textbf{solutions} for each instance.
  \end{define*}

  \vspace{1em}
  Similarly, RT is a problem; its instances are the collection of colorings
  $c:[\omega]^n\rightarrow k$ for every $n,k\in\omega$, and the solutions
  for each $c$ are the class of $c$-homogeneous paths.

  \vspace{1em}
  For instance, WWKL is a problem; its instances are the collection of
  binary trees with positive measure, the solutions of each instance is the
  class of paths in the tree.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Strongly Omnisciently Computably Reducible
($\leq_{\text{soc}}$)}
  \begin{define*}[Strongly Omnisciently Computably Reducible]
    Problem \textbf{P} is \textit{soc}-reducible to problem \textbf{Q}
    (written \textbf{P} $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ \textbf{Q}) if for every
    \textbf{P}-instance \textit{I}, there is a \textbf{Q}-instance
    \textit{J} such that every solution to \textit{J} computes a solution
    to \textit{I}.
  \end{define*}

  $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ successfully captures this expected relation:
  \begin{center}
    WWKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ WKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ KL.
  \end{center}

  \vspace{0.5em}
  \textbf{WWKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ WKL:} Given a binary tree with
  positive measure, this tree has infinite branches and is therefore an
  instance of WKL. The desired relation follows from definition of
  $\leq_{\text{soc}}$.

  \vspace{0.5em}
  \textbf{WKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ KL:} Given a binary tree with infinite
  branches, this tree is finitely-branching and therefore an instance of
  WKL. The desired relation follows from definition of $\leq_{\text{soc}}$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{KL, RT $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ WKL}
  WKL is powerful under $\leq_{\text{soc}}$. Given any KL or RT
  instance, fix one of its solutions, and choose the WKL instance whose only
  path codes that solution as an path in $2^\omega$. By definition of
  $\leq_{\text{soc}}$, the given instance reduces to this WKL instance.

  \vspace{1em}
  For example, given a KL instance, fix one of its solutions
  $f:\omega\rightarrow\omega$, code this solution as a path in $2^\omega$
  in a recoverable manner.

  \vspace{1em}
  For instance, if $f$ is $2,9,3,\ldots$, we can code $f$ as the binary
  sequence $110$ $1111111110$ $1110\ldots$.

  \vspace{1em}
  Similarly, any solution of an RT instance can be seen as an infinite
  subset of $\omega$. Its characteristic function will be a path in
  $2^\omega$.
