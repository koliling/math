\begin{frame}{Ramsey's Theorem asserts Homogeneity}
  \begin{define*}[$c$-homogeneous]
    Given $k$-coloring $c:[\omega]^n\rightarrow k$, a subset
    $A\subseteq\omega$ is \textbf{$c$-homogeneous} if every $n$-tuple over
    $A$ is given the same color by $c$.
  \end{define*}

  \vspace{0.5em}
  \begin{thm*}[Ramsey's]
    Fix $n,k\leq1$. \textbf{$\text{RT}_k^n$} is the statement that every
    $k$-coloring $c:[\omega]^n\rightarrow k$ has an infinite
    $c$-homogeneous set.\\
    \vspace{0.5em}
    \textbf{RT} is the statement $(\forall n)(\forall k)\; \text{RT}_k^n$.
  \end{thm*}
  \textbf{Proof sketch:} $\text{RT}_2^1$ holds since in any 2-coloring of
  $\omega$, one of the colors gives an infinite set. Induct on $n$ to get
  $\text{RT}_2^n$. Then inductively group colors together to get
  $\text{RT}_k^n$ from $\text{RT}_2^n$. $\square$

\begin{frame}{Lebesgue measure}
  \begin{define*}[Outer, inner measure]
    $\mu(\llbracket\sigma\rrbracket) =2^{-|\sigma|}$. The \textbf{outer
    measure} of $\mathcal{A}\subseteq2^\omega$ is
    \[\mu^*(\mathcal{A}):= \inf\left\{\sum_{n\in\omega}
    \mu(\llbracket\sigma_n\rrbracket): \mathcal{A}\subseteq
    \bigcup_{n\in\omega} \llbracket\sigma_n\rrbracket\right\}.\]
    Its \textbf{inner measure} is $\mu_*(\mathcal{A}):=
    1-\mu^*(\bar{\mathcal{A}})$.
  \end{define*}

  \begin{define*}[Lesbegue measure, null]
    $\mathcal{A}\subseteq2^\omega$ is \textbf{measurable} iff
    $\mu^*(\mathcal{A}) =\mu_*(\mathcal{A})$.  Then we say its
    \textbf{measure} is $\mu(\mathcal{A}) =\mu^*(\mathcal{A})
    =\mu_*(\mathcal{A})$. $\mathcal{A}$ is \textbf{null} iff
    $\mu(\mathcal{A})=0$.
  \end{define*}
  \begin{fact*}[Measurable]
    $\mathcal{A}\subseteq2^\omega$ is measurable iff it is
    $G_\delta$ (countable intersection of open sets) modulo a null. E.g.
    open sets, closed sets are measurable.

\begin{frame}{1-random}
  \begin{notation*}[Tree, real]
    The set of \textbf{reals} $A\in\omega^\omega$ contained in a
    \textbf{tree} $T\subseteq\omega^{<\omega}$ is denoted by $\llbracket
    T\rrbracket:= \{A\in\omega^\omega: (\exists n)\; [A\restriction n \in
    T]\}$.
  \end{notation*}

  \begin{define*}[Martin-Lof test of randomness]
    An effective enumeration of recursive trees $T_0,T_1,\ldots \subseteq
    2^{<\omega}$ is a \textbf{Martin-Lof test} if
    $\mu(\llbracket T_n\rrbracket) \leq 2^{-n}$ for all $n\in\omega$.\\
    \vspace{0.5em}
    A real $A\in2^\omega$ passes this test of randomness iff $A\not\in
    \bigcup_{n\in\omega} \llbracket T_n\rrbracket$.
  \end{define*}

  \begin{define*}[1-random]
    $A\in2^\omega$ is \textbf{1-random} if it passes every Martin-Lof test.
  \end{define*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Set of non 1-randoms is null}
  \begin{fact*}
    The set of reals that is not 1-random is null.
  \end{fact*}

  \vspace{2em}
  \textbf{Proof sketch:} There are only countably many Turing machines, so
  there can only be countably many Martin-Lof tests. The set of reals that
  fail a test is null since the trees in a test descend quickly. The union
  of a countable set of null sets is still null, thus the set of reals that
  fail some Martin-Lof test is null. $\square$

\begin{frame}{WWKL asserts Randomness}
  \begin{thm*}[Weak Weak Konig's Lemma]
    If $T\subseteq 2^{<\omega}$ with positive measure i.e.
    \[\lim_n \frac{|\{\sigma\in T: |\sigma|=n\}|}{2^n} >0,\]
    it contains a real.
  \end{thm*}
  \begin{fact*}
    $T\subseteq2^{<\omega}$ has positive measure if and only if the set of
    reals with infinitely many initial segments contained in $T$ has
    positive measure.
  \end{fact*}

  \begin{coro*}
    If a binary tree has positive measure, it contains a 1-random.
  \end{coro*}

  \textbf{WWKL asserts randomness.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{WWKL, WKL, KL}
  The reals of a WKL problem however, may all be non-randoms, because WKL
  includes also binary trees which are null:
  \begin{thm*}[Weak Konig's Lemma]
    Every binary tree with infinite nodes contains a real.
  \end{thm*}

  \vspace{2em}
  Konig's Lemma includes even trees that are not binary:
  \begin{thm*}[Konig's Lemma]
    Every finitely-branching tree with infinite nodes contains a real.
  \end{thm*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Homogeneity versus Randomness}
  A natural question to ask is which of the statements RT, KL, WKL, WWKL is
  stronger. Intuitively, WKL is stronger than WWKL, because a binary tree
  of positive measure has infinite nodes, so if all binary trees with
  infinite nodes have a real, then those with positive measure must
  have one too. A question that is harder to answer is:
  \newtheorem*{question*}{Question}
  \begin{question*}
    Which notion is stronger, homogeneity or randomness?
  \end{question*}
  If a given a real is homogeneous, does that say anything about how random
  it is? Likewise, if a given real is random, will it necessarily provide
  information on finding homogeneous reals?

  \vspace{0.5em}
  Since the notions of homogeneity and randomness are captured by RT and
  WWKL respectively, we are essentially asking which of RT and WWKL is
  stronger.

\begin{frame}{Problem, Instance, Solution}
  \vspace{1em}
  \begin{define*}
    A mathematical \textbf{problem} is a collection of \textbf{instances},
    with a collection of \textbf{solutions} for each instance.
  \end{define*}

  \vspace{1em}
  \textbf{E.g. 1:} RT is a problem; its instances are the collections of
  colorings $c:[\omega]^n\rightarrow k$ for every $n,k\in\omega$, and the
  solutions of each $c$ are the class of $c$-homogeneous reals.

  \vspace{1em}
  \textbf{E.g. 2:} WWKL is a problem; its instances are the collections of
  binary trees with positive measure, and the solutions of each instance is
  the class of reals in the tree.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Strongly Omnisciently Computably Reducible
($\leq_{\text{soc}}$)}
  \begin{define*}[Strongly Omnisciently Computably Reducible]
    Problem \textbf{P} is \textit{soc}-reducible to problem \textbf{Q}
    (written \textbf{P} $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ \textbf{Q}) if for every
    \textbf{P}-instance \textit{I}, there is a \textbf{Q}-instance
    \textit{J} such that every solution to \textit{J} computes a solution
    to \textit{I}.
  \end{define*}

  $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ successfully captures this expected relation:
  \begin{center}
    WWKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ WKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ KL.
  \end{center}

  \vspace{0.5em}
  \textbf{WWKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ WKL:} Given a binary tree with
  positive measure, this tree has infinite branches and is therefore an
  instance of WKL. The desired relation follows from definition of
  $\leq_{\text{soc}}$.

  \vspace{0.5em}
  \textbf{WKL $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ KL:} Given a binary tree with infinite
  branches, this tree is finitely-branching and therefore an instance of
  WKL. The desired relation follows from definition of $\leq_{\text{soc}}$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{KL, RT $\leq_{\text{soc}}$ WKL}
  WKL is powerful under $\leq_{\text{soc}}$. Given any KL or RT
  instance, fix one of its solutions, and choose the WKL instance whose only
  real codes that solution as an real in $2^\omega$. By definition of
  $\leq_{\text{soc}}$, the given instance reduces to this WKL instance.

  \vspace{1em}
  For example, given a KL instance, fix one of its solutions
  $f:\omega\rightarrow\omega$, code this solution as a real in $2^\omega$
  in a recoverable manner.

  \vspace{1em}
  For instance, if $f$ is $2,9,3,\ldots$, we can code $f$ as the real
  $110$ $1111111110$ $1110\ldots$.

  \vspace{1em}
  Similarly, any solution of an RT instance can be seen as an infinite
  subset of $\omega$. Its characteristic function will be a real in
  $2^\omega$.
