  \begin{fact}
    Every countable set is null/meagre. There exists non null/meagre sets.
  \end{fact}

  \begin{definition}
    \textbf{non-$(\mu)$} is the smallest cardinality of a non null/meagre set.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}
    $R$ is a relation between a set of problems and a set of solutions.
    $xRy$ if $y$ is a solution that solves $x$. Define $\tilde{r}$ as the
    cardinality of the smallest family of $R$-solutions that contains a
    solution for every $R$-problem.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{example}
    A $B$-problem is a function $\omega\rightarrow\omega$, and
    a $B$-solution is a function $\omega\rightarrow\omega$. Let non-$(\mu)$
    be where the problem is a meagre set whose solution is a real no tin
    the set. Then $A$ is a set of solutions to every problem iff $A$ is
    non-meagre.
  \end{example}

  \begin{definition}
    For a relation $R$, define $\hat{R}$ by $x\hat{R}y \leftrightarrow \neg
    yRx$.
  \end{definition}
