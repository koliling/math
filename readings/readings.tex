\section{Arithmetical Hierarchy}
  \subsection{Computably Enumerable Degrees}
    \begin{theorem}
      There are non c.e. degrees below $\emptyset'$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      Cooper Epstein-Lachlan theorem.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}
      There are no minimal c.e. degrees.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      Sack's Density theorem.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{question}
      Do all non-minimal degrees have infinite incomparable degrees below
      them? How about just finite?
    \end{question}
    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}

  \subsection{Lattice $\mathcal{D}$}
    \begin{question}
      Given $A\leq_T B$, must there be a degree between them? I.e. Does
      Sack's density theorem be generalized to degrees that are not
      necessarily c.e.? How about infinite pairwise incomparable degrees
      between $A$ and $B$?
    \end{question}
    \begin{proof}
      Consider local and global degrees?
    \end{proof}

    \begin{question}
      Given any non-recursive non-minimal degree, are there always infinite
      pairwise incomparable degrees beneath it?
    \end{question}
    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{question}
      Is $\mathcal{D}$ a lattice? In particular, do any two Turing degrees
      have a greatest lower bound? How about distributivity?
    \end{question}
    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{question}
      Does $\mathcal{D}_{\leq\emptyset'}$ have a maximal degree?
    \end{question}
    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}

  \subsection{Randoms and Generics}
    \begin{question}
      Is there any relation between 1-random sets and 1-generic sets? I
      suspect all 1-generics are 1-random, but the converse isn't true? Is
      there a result similar to one for hyperimmune degrees, which says
      that the hyperimmune degrees are exactly those that are comparable
      with $\emptyset'$?
    \end{question}
    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{question}
      Is there a 1-random in every non-recursive degree? Is there a result
      similar to one for hyperimmune degrees, which says that the
      hyperimmune degrees are exactly those that are comparable with
      $\emptyset'$?
    \end{question}
    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}
\end{document}
