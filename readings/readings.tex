\section{Maximal Sets}
  \begin{notation}
    Given $A,B\subseteq\omega$, write
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A=^*B$ iff $|A\Delta B|<\omega$, i.e. $A$ and $B$ are equal
        except for a finite number of elements.
      \item $A\subseteq^*B$ iff $|A-B|<\omega$, i.e., $B$ contains almost
        every element of $A$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{notation}

  \begin{definition}
    A r.e. set $M\subset\omega$ is \textit{maximal} iff
    $|M|=|\overline{M}|=\omega$, and given any r.e. set $N$, if
    $M\subseteq^* N$, then either $N=^*M$ or $N=^*\omega$; i.e. anything
    that lies between $M$ and $\omega$ must be almost equal to one of them.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}
    A set $C$ is \textit{cohesive} if there is no r.e. set $W$ such that
    both $W\cap C$ and $\overline{W}\cap C$ are infinite.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{lemma}
    A r.e. set is maximal if and only if its complement is cohesive.
    \label{lemma:maximal-cohesive}
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Chase definitions. If a r.e. set $M$ does not have a cohesive
    complement, let $W$ be the witness of the non-cohesiveness of
    $\overline{M}$. Then $M\cup W$ will witness the non-maximality of $M$.
    Conversely, if $M$ is not maximal with witness $W$, then $W$ will also
    witness the non-cohesiveness of $\overline{M}$.
  \end{proof}

\subsection{Maximal Sets}
  \begin{theorem}
    There exists a maximal set.
  \end{theorem}

  From Lemma~\ref{lemma:maximal-cohesive}, it suffices to construct a r.e.
  set $A$ that satisfies requirements
  \begin{equation}
    |\overline{A}|=\omega,
    \label{eqn:R}
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    P_e: \overline{A} \subseteq^*\overline{W}_e\;\; \text{or}\;\;
    \overline{A}\subseteq^* W_e.
    \label{eqn:P_e}
  \end{equation}

  At stage $s$, write $\overline{A}_s =\{a_0^s<a_1^s<a_2^s\ldots\}$. Notice
  that $a_i^0\leq a_i^1\leq a_i^2\leq\ldots$ while we enumerate elements
  from $\overline{A}_s$ into $A_s$ at stage $s+1$. Hence to ensure that
  $|\overline{A}|=\omega$, it suffices to show that $a_n:=\lim_s a_n^s$
  exists for each $n\in\omega$. Assuming all $a_n$ exist, we can write
  $\overline{A}=\{a_0<a_1<\ldots\}$.

  \begin{notation}
    Given $x\in\omega$, we say the $e$-state of $x$ at stage $s$ is
    \[\sigma(e,x,s) =\{i\leq e: x\in W_{i,s}\} \in 2^{e+1}.\]
    For example, $e$-state 100 means $x\in W_{0,s}$ but $x\not\in
    W_{1,s}$ and $x\not\in W_{2,s}$. Notice that there are only $2^{e+1}$
    possible $e$-states.
  \end{notation}

  \begin{proof}
    At stage 0, let $A_0=\emptyset$, so that $\overline{A}_0=\omega$. At
    stage $s+1$, we consider which of $a_0^s<a_1^s<\ldots<a_s^s$ should be
    enumerated into $A_{s+1}$. Our strategy is to maximize the $e$-state
    corresponding to the highest priority requirement. Specifically, given
    $e\leq s$, see if there is some $e<i\leq s$ such that the $e$-state of
    $a_i^s$ is greater than the $e$-state of $a_e^s$. Let $e\leq s$ be the
    smallest requirement where such $i$ exists. Enumerate
    $a_e^s,\ldots,a_{i-1}^s$ into $A_s$.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}
    $a_i:=\lim_s a_i^s$ exists.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Notice that $a_0^s$ increases at stage $s$ if and only if $0$-state of
    $a_0^s$ increases in the next stage. But there are only $2^{0+1}=2$
    possible $0$-states. So $a_0^s$ can only increase at most once. By
    strong induction, after $a_0,\ldots,a_{e-1}$ have stabilized, $a_e$
    can only increase at most $2^{e+1}$ times before stabilizing too.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}
    $P_e$ is satisfied.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Assume $P_0$ is not satisfied. Then there must be some
    $a_i\in\overline{A}$ such that $a_i\in W_0$ but $a_{i+1}\not\in W_0$.
    Wait till $a_0,\ldots,a_{i+1}$ have stabilized. Then
    the $i$-state of $a_i$ will be smaller than the $i$-state of $a_{i+1}$
    since $a_i\in W_0$ but $a_{i+1}\not\in W_0$. By our strategy, we will
    enumerate $a_i$ into $A$, a contradiction. \\

    Assume $P_0,\ldots,P_e$ are satisfied, but not $P_{e+1}$. Let
    $a_n\in\overline{A}$ be the smallest element such that for all
    $a_m>a_n$ and all $i\leq e$, the $i$-state of $a_m$ equals the
    $i$-state of $a_n$. Wait till all $a_0,\ldots,a_n$ have stabilized.
    Choose $a_p<a_q$ bigger than $a_n$ such that $a_p\in W_{e+1}$ but
    $a_q\not\in W_{e+1}$. But then the $(e+1)$-state of $a_p$ will be
    smaller than that of $a_q$, and we will enumerate $a_p$ into $A$, a
    contradiction.
  \end{proof}

\subsection{Degrees of Maximal Sets}
  \begin{goal}
    $\bm{d}$ is high $\Leftrightarrow$ $\bm{d}$ contains maximal set
  \end{goal}

  \begin{remark}
    The easy direction is to show that maximal sets have high degree. 
  \end{remark}

  \begin{lemma}
    If $M$ is a maximal set then $p_{\overline{M}}$ is dominant.
    \label{lemma:high-maximal}
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Assume recursive function $p_{\overline{M}}$ is dominated by recursive
    function $f$. We can assume $f$ is strictly increasing and majorizes
    $p_{\overline{M}}$. Observe that
    $p_{\overline{M}}(n)\in[n,f(n)-1]$. In particular, $[0,f(0)-1]$
    contains an element of $\overline{M}$. Then $[f(0),f(f(0))-1]$ contains
    an element of $\overline{M}$, and $[f(f(0)),f(f(f(0)))-1]$ contains an
    element of $\overline{M}$, and so on. But these are disjoint intervals,
    so by picking every other interval, we can choose enumerate an infinite
    number of elements of $\overline{M}$, leaving an infinite number of
    elements of $\overline{M}$. \\

    Assume that $f$ does not dominate $p_{\overline{M}}$, but instead
    crosses over it infinitely many times. Then there are infinite disjoint
    intervals $(f(x),f(x+1)]$ that contain two or more elements of
    $\overline{M}$. So by enumerating $M$ and searching for the first
    element in each interval that is not in $M_s$, we can extend $M$ by
    infinite elements, leaving infinite elements unenumerated.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{theorem}
    \textit{(High Domination Theorem)} A set $A$ satisfies
    $\emptyset''\leq_T A'$ if and only if it computes a dominant function.
    \label{thm:high-domination}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Recall that $\text{Tot}\equiv_T \emptyset''$, so by the limit lemma
    relativized to $A$, we have $\emptyset''\leq_T A'$ iff there is a
    $A$-recursive binary function $g(e,s)$ such that $\lim_s g(e,s)
    =\chi_{\text{Tot}}(e)$. \\

    Assume $\emptyset''\leq_T A'$. We use $g$ to construct a dominant
    function $f$. Given $e$ and stage $s$, let $t_s(e)$ be the first stage
    $t>s$ such that either $g(e,t)=0$ or $\varphi_{e,t}\restriction
    t\downarrow$. In other words, $t_s(e)$ be the first stage greater than
    $s$ where either $\varphi_e$ is shown to be not total from $g$, or
    shown to be total up to $t$. Then setting $f(s)=\max\{t_s(e):e\leq s\}$
    works. \\

    For the converse, let $f(s)$ be a dominant function. Construct $g(e,s)$
    as
    \begin{align*}
      g(e,s) :=
      \begin{cases}
        1 &\text{if}\; \varphi_{e,f(s)}\restriction s\downarrow,\\
        0 &\text{otherwise}.
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
  \end{proof}

  \begin{corollary}
    Every maximal set has a high degree.
  \end{corollary}
  \begin{proof}
    Follows directly from Theorem~\ref{thm:high-domination} and
    Lemma~\ref{lemma:high-maximal}.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{remark}
    Coding -- Given $B$, construct r.e. $A\; \prescript{}{T}{\geq}\; B$.
  \end{remark}
  Encode $B$ into $A$ in a recoverable way. E.g. if $B=\{b_0,b_1,\ldots\}$,
  then at stage $s$ enumerate $a_{b_s}^s$ into $A$. Given $A$, to decide if
  $b\in B$, simulate to stage $s$ where the first $b+1$ elements of $A$
  have stabilized; then $b\in B \Leftrightarrow a_{b}^s\in A_s$.

  \begin{remark}
    Permitting -- Given r.e. $B \prescript{}{T}{\geq}\; \emptyset'$,
    construct r.e. $A\leq_T B$.
  \end{remark}
  $x$ enters $A$ only if $B$ permits it. At stage $s$, to satisfy
  requirement $R$, want to enumerate $n$ into $A$. $B$ permits $n$ to
  enter only if the first $n$ elements of $B$ have not stabilized, i.e.
  when we find a stage $t\geq s$ such that $B_{t+1}\restriction n \neq
  B_t\restriction n$. \\

  Then given $B$, to decide if $n\in A$, wait for stage $s$ where the first
  $n$ elements of $B$ have stabilized; then $n\in A \Leftrightarrow n\in
  A_s$. \\

  We show that as long as requirement $R$ has infinitely many potential
  witnesses $n$, eventually one of them will be permitted to enter $A$.
  Assume otherwise. Then we will be able to compute $B$, as follows. To
  decide if $n\in B$, simulate till stage $s$ where $R$ offers potential
  witness $m>n$. Then since $m$ is never permitted to enter $A$,
  $B\restriction m=B_s\restriction m$. Thus $n\in B \Leftrightarrow n\in
  B_s$.

  \begin{theorem}
    Every high r.e. degree contains an r.e. set $D$ whose computation
    function $c_{\overline{D}}$ is dominant, where $\overline{D}_s
    =\{d_0^s<d_1^s<\ldots\}$, and $c_{\overline{D}}(x) =(\mu
    s)[d_x^s=d_x]$.
    \label{thm:high-dominant}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    By High Domination Theorem~\ref{thm:high-domination}, if
    $\text{deg}(A)\in\bm{H}_1$, then $A$ computes a dominant function
    $f=\Phi^A$. Let $c_f$ be modulus of $A$:
    \[c_f(x) =(\mu t) (\forall s\geq t)\; [\Phi_s^{A_s}(x)
    =\Phi_t^{A_t}(x)].\]

    Then $c_f\leq_T A$ by Modulus Lemma. Also, $c_f$ is dominant, because
    if recursive $g\prescript{*}{}{>}\; c_f$, then recursive
    $\Phi_{g(x)}^{A_{g(x)}}+1 \prescript{*}{}{>}\; f$. \\

    Construct $\{D_s\}_{s\in\omega}$, with $D_0=\emptyset$. At stage $s+1$,
    \\

    \textit{Step 1.} (Permitting) If $\Phi_{s+1}^{A_{s+1}}(x)
    \neq\Phi_{s}^{A_{s}}(x)$, enumerate $d_x^s$ into $D$. \\

    \textit{Step 2.} (Coding) Enumerate $d_{a_s}^s$ into $D$. \\

    \underline{Verification.} From permitting and coding, we have
    $A\equiv_T D$. From step 1, $c_f(x) \leq c_{\overline{D}}(x)$. In
    particular, $c_{\overline{D}}$ is dominant.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{theorem}
    Every high degree $\bm{d}$ contains a maximal set $A$.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Satisfy requirements
    \[R_e: \overline{A} \subseteq^* \overline{W}_e\; \text{or}\;
    \overline{A} \subseteq^* W_e.\]

    Let $D\in\bm{d}$ be r.e. as in Theorem~\ref{thm:high-dominant}. Let
    $D_0=\emptyset$. At stage $s$, if $a_i^s<a_j^s$ and $\sigma(i,a_i^s,s)
    <\sigma(i,a_j^s,s)$, we say $a_i^s$ is attracted to $a_j^s$ for the
    sake of requirement $R_i$. At stage $s+1$: \\

    \textit{Step 1.} Choose least $i\leq s$ such that
    $a_i^s$ is attracted to some larger $a_j^s$ for $R_i$, and
    \[(\exists y\leq a_i^s)\; [d_y^{s+1} \neq d_y^s].\]
    In the first condition, we maximise the $i$-state of the element of
    highest priority to satisfy $R_i$, and in the second condition, $D$
    permits elements of lower $i$-state to be enumerated into $A$, to
    satisfy $A\leq_T D$. Choose the minimum $j>i$ such that $a_j^s$ gives
    the highest $i$-state. Enumerate
    \[a_i^s, a_{i+1}^s, \ldots, a_{j-1}^s, a_{j+1}^s, \ldots, a_s^s\]
    into $A$. If there is no such $a_j^s$ do nothing. \\

    \textit{Step 2.} (Code $D$ into $A$) Let
    \[z =(\mu y) [d_y^{s+1} \neq d_y^s].\]
    If some $x\leq a_{z+1}^s$ was enumerated into $A$ in Step 1 do nothing.
    Otherwise enumerate whichever of $a_z^s$ and $a_{z+1}^s$ has the lower
    $z$-state into $A$. By retaining the element of higher $z$-state, we
    ensure that if some $x<a_z^s$ was attracted to one of $a_z^s$ or
    $a_{z+1}^s$, then $x$ remains attracted to the element that remains in
    $\overline{A}$ after step 2.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}
    $a_i :=\lim_s a_i^s$ exists.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    From finiteness of the number of $i$-states.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}
    $A\equiv_T D$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Step 2 ensures $D\leq_T A$, because if $a_{x+1}^s=a_{x+1}$, then
    $d_x^s=d_x$. Second, $A\leq_T D$ from permitting.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}
    $R_e$ is satisfied, and $\forall^{\text{a.e.}} i,j\;
    [\sigma(e,a_i)=\sigma(e,a_j)]$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Assume lemma true for $i<e$ but false for $e$. We define a recursive
    $h(x)$ not dominated by $c_{\overline{D}}(x)$. Choose $n\in\omega$ and
    stage $s_0\in\omega$ large enough such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\forall i\geq n\; [\sigma(e-1,a_i) =\sigma(e-1,a_n)]$
      \item $a_0,\ldots,a_n$ have stabilized by stage $s_0$
    \end{itemize}

    Then $\forall i\geq n$, $\sigma(e,a_m) =\sigma(e-1,a_n)^\frown0
    =\sigma_0$ or $\sigma(e-1,a_n)^\frown1 =\sigma_1$. Then since
    $|\overline{A}\cap W_e|=|\overline{A}\cap\overline{W}_e| =\omega$,
    there are infinite $a_i$ with $e$-state $\sigma_0$ and infinite $a_i$
    with $e$-state $\sigma_1$. \\

    Thus each $a_i\not\in W_e$ will be attracted to some $x>a_i$ during
    construction; the attractor may be some $a_j>a_i$ with $e$-state
    $\sigma_1$, or some $x$ that is eventually enumerated into $A$. \\

    So given arbitrary $x>a_n$, after stage $s_0$, one of the following
    cases must happen:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $x$ is enumerated into $A$
      \item $e$-state of $x$ is $\sigma_1$
      \item $e$-state of $x$ is $\sigma_0$ and $x$ is attracted to some
        larger element $y$ with $e$-state $\sigma_1$
    \end{enumerate}

    Define $h(x)$ to be the first stage where one of the above happens.
    Since $|\overline{A}\cap\overline{W}_e|=\omega$, there are infinite
    elements $a_i\in\overline{A}$ that belong to case 3 above. Assume that
    once such $a_i$ is attracted to a larger element, it will forever be
    attracted to a larger element, even if the larger element is enumerated
    into $A$. \\

    Now $D$ permits $a_i$ to be enumerated into $A$ if $a_0,\ldots,a_i$
    stabilizes before $d_0,\ldots,d_{a_i}$ does. So since these $a_i$'s
    were never permitted to enter $A$, and each $a_i$ is always attracted
    to something larger, it must be that $d_0,\ldots,d_{a_i}$
    stabilized before stage $h(a_i)$. Yet $c_{\overline{D}}$ dominates
    $h(x)$, so for large enough $a_i$, $d_0,\ldots,d_{a_i}$ should
    stabilize after $a_0,\ldots,a_i$, a contradiction. \\

    Thus it suffices to prove that if $a_i\in\overline{A}$ falls under case
    3 above for the first time, it will forever be attracted to a larger
    element, even if the larger element is enumerated into $A$. There are
    two possible cases. In the first case, the larger element is enumerated
    into $A$ under step 1. Then $a_i$ must be attracted to the first
    element that is brought forward after the enumeration. In the second
    case, the larger element is enumerated into $A$ under step 2. Then
    $a_i$ must be attracted to either the element before or after its
    initial attractor. \\
  \end{proof}

\section{$\bm{PS}=\bm{NC}=\bm{ENC}$}
  In this section we show that class of promptly simple degrees are exactly
  the class of non-capable degrees.

\subsection{Infinite Injury Constructions}
  Construct r.e. $A$ in stages $s$ s.t. $A=\cup_{s\in\omega} A_s$,
  $A_s\subseteq A_{s+1}$. Satisfy requirements
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $N_e$: Restraints $r(e,s)$ prevent elements from being enumerated
      into $A$ \\
      \COMMENT{e.g. $\Phi_e^A\neq B$ for a fixed r.e. B. Preserve
      computation once we find the first witness $x$ where
      $\Phi_e^{A_s}(x)\neq B_s(x)$. Requirement is negative since it
      prevents elements from being enumerated into $A$. Define $r(e,s)$ to
      preserve computations up to and including first witness, if found:
      \begin{align*}
        l(e,s) &:=\mu(x\leq s) (\forall y<x)[\Phi_e^{A_s}(y) \downarrow\neq
          B(y)]\\
        r(e,s) &:=\max_{y\leq x} \{\text{use}(A_s;e,y,s)\}\\
      \end{align*}
      }

    \item $P_e$: Enumerate element into $A$ \\
      \COMMENT{e.g. $|W_e|=\omega \implies W_e\cap A\neq\emptyset$.
      Requirement is positive since it adds elements into $A$.}
  \end{itemize}

  If each $P_e$ only adds finite elements into $A$ before it is satisfied
  forever, then lower priority requirements $N_{e+1},N_{e+2}\ldots$ will be
  injured at most finitely many times by higher priority requirements
  $P_0,\ldots,P_e$.\\

  However, if each positive requirement needs infinite elements to be
  enumerated into $A$ before being satisfied, then negative requirements
  $N_e$ may be injured infinitely often by higher priority positive
  requirements $P_0,\ldots,P_{e-1}$.\\

  Need to ensure that $N_e$ is still satisfied despite being injured
  infinitely often.

\subsection{Promptly Simple Sets}
  \begin{theorem}
    \textbf{(Promptly Simple Degree Theorem)} Let $A$ be an r.e. set and
    $\{A_s\}_{s\in\omega}$ a recursive enumeration of $A$. Then
    $\text{deg}(A) \in\bm{PS}$ iff there is a recursive function $p(s)$ such
    that for all $s$, $p(s)\geq s$, and for all $e$,
    \begin{equation}
      W_e\; \text{infinite}\; \implies (\exists x,s)\; [x\in
      W_{e,\text{at}\; s}\; \wedge\; A_s\restriction x \neq
      A_{p(s)}\restriction x]
      \label{eqn:promptly-permit}
    \end{equation}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    ($\Leftarrow$) Let $B=\Phi^A$ be promptly simple with enumeration
    $\{B_s\}_{s\in\omega}$ and recursive function $p(s)$.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{recall}
    An r.e. set $A$ has a PS degree if it is promptly permitting, i.e.
    there exists a recursive $p(s)\geq s$ such that $\forall e\in\omega$,
    \[|W_e|=\infty \implies (\exists x)(\exists s) [x\in W_{e, \text{at}\;
    s}\; \text{and}\; A_s\restriction x \neq A_{p(s)}\restriction x].\]
  \end{recall}

  \begin{recall}
    An r.e. set $A$ is cappable iff there exists an r.e. set
    $B\prescript{}{T}{>}0$ such that the only r.e. set computable by $A$
    and $B$ are the recursive sets.
  \end{recall}

  \begin{recall}
    An r.e. set $A$ is non-cappable (NC) if it is not cappable.
    Equivalently, an r.e. set $A$ is NC iff given any r.e. set
    $B\prescript{}{T}{>}0$, there exists an r.e. set $C\prescript{}{T}{>}0$
    computable by $A$ and $B$.
  \end{recall}

  \begin{recall}
    An r.e. set $A$ is effectively non-cappable (ENC) if the $C$ above can
    be computed effectively, i.e. there exist recursive functions
    $f(e)$, $g(e)$, $h(e)$ such that for all $e\in\omega$,
    \[\Phi_{f(e)} =\Phi_{g(e)}^A =\Phi_{h(e)}^{W_e},\]
    and if $W_e\prescript{}{T}{>}0$, then $\Phi_{f(e)}\prescript{}{T}{>}0$.
  \end{recall}

  \begin{recall}
    An r.e. degree is NC (ENC) iff it contains a non-cappable (effectively
    non-cappable) set.
  \end{recall}

  \begin{recall}
    $\text{ENC}$ forms a strong filter in $R$.
  \end{recall}

  \begin{recall}
    $\text{PS} \subseteq \text{ENC} \subseteq \text{NC}$.
  \end{recall}

  \begin{goal}
    $\text{NC} \subseteq \text{PS}$.
  \end{goal}

  \begin{corollary}
    $\text{PS}=\text{ENC}=\text{NC}$, and they all form strong filters in
    $R$.
  \end{corollary}

  \begin{proof}
    Fix an arbitrary r.e. set $B$. We show $B$ either has a PS degree or is
    cappable with witness $A$. We construct r.e. $A$ such that the either
    $B$ is found to be PS, or $A$ satisfies for all $i,j\in\omega$ the
    requirements
    \begin{equation}
      N_{\langle i,j\rangle}: \Phi_i^A=\Phi_j^B=f_{\langle i,j\rangle}
      =\text{total function} \implies f_{\langle i,j\rangle}\; \text{is
      recursive}
      \label{eqn:cappable1}
    \end{equation}
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}
    For $A$ above to satisfy \eqref{eqn:cappable1}, it suffices to show $A$
    to satisfy for all $e\in\omega$,
    \begin{equation}
      N_e: \Phi_e^A=\Phi_e^B=f_e =\text{total function} \implies f_e\;
      \text{is recursive}.
      \label{eqn:cappable2}
    \end{equation}
  \end{lemma}
