\subsection{Stability Problem}

\begin{goal}[Mostowski, 1996]
  There are many formulae $F$ strongly representing $Z$ (the relation
  $\text{PROOF}_T(x,y)$) in $T$; Godel's theorem is valid only for one such
  formulae. It is not immediately obvious why the theorem proved for this
  formula
  \[T \not\vdash (\forall x)\; [\neg\text{PROOF}_T(x, \ulcorner
  0=1\urcorner)]\]

  should have philosophical importance while a similar theorem obtained by
  a different choice of formula strongly representing $Z$ (could be) simply
  false.
\end{goal}

\begin{notation}
  $T$ is any theory like PA or $Q$.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[CON(T)]
  This is the formula
  \[(\exists x)\; [\text{FORM}_T(x) \wedge \neg\text{Pr}_T(x)].\]

  Note that $\text{Pr}_T(x)$ is c.e., and $\text{FORM}_T(x)$ is computable.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[CON'(T)]
  This is the formula
  \[(\forall x)\; [\neg\text{PROOF}_T(x, \ulcorner 0=1\urcorner)].\]

  Note that $\text{PROOF}_T$ is computable.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Strongly Representable]
  A relation $R$ (on some set $S \subseteq$ universe of $\mathcal{M}$, a
  model of $T$) is said to be strongly representable with respect to the
  theory if there is a formula $\phi(\bar{x})$ such that 

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\bar{a}\in R \implies T\vdash \phi(\bar{a})$,
    \item $\bar{a}\not\in R \implies T\vdash \neg\phi(\bar{a})$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}[Strongly Representable]
  The strongly representable relations are precisely the computable ones
  (Cooper's chapter on Godel).
\end{fact}

\begin{definition}[Weakly Representable]
  A relation $R$ is such that there is a formula $\phi(\bar{x})$ such that

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\bar{a}\in R \implies T\vdash \phi(\bar{a})$,
    \item $\bar{a}\not\in R \implies T\not\vdash \phi(\bar{a})$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}[Weakly Representable]
  The weakly representable relations are precisely the c.e. relations.
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
  The arithmetic sets are strongly representable over PA.
\end{fact}
