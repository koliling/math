\begin{question}
  Is Borel necessary for Galvin-Prikry to hold? In other words, is
  there a weaker condition that will ensure we observe the structure of
  Galvin-Prikry?
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
  Probably not. Silver's result improved Galvin-Prikry but only in a
  special case. There is a book with these results.
\end{proof}
