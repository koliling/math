\begin{question}
  Is there any relation between 1-random sets and 1-generic sets? I
  suspect all 1-generics are 1-random, but the converse isn't true? Is
  there a result similar to one for hyperimmune degrees, which says
  that the hyperimmune degrees are exactly those that are comparable
  with $\emptyset'$?
\end{question}
