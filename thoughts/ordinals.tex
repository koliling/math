\begin{question}
  Are inaccessible ordinals analogous to non-standard numbers?
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
  Inaccessible ordinals seem to appear out of the blue, breaking the
  intuitive way of visualizing ordinals as a single linear chain.
  Perhaps we can think of them the same way we think of non-standard
  numbers; the inaccessible ordinals (non-standard numbers) form linear
  chain of ordinals (numbers) parallel to the standard line of ordinals
  (numbers).
\end{proof}
