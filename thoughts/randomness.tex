\begin{question}
  Is there a 1-random in every non-recursive degree? Is there a result
  similar to one for hyperimmune degrees, which says that the
  hyperimmune degrees are exactly those that are comparable with
  $\emptyset'$?
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{question}
  Is randomness independent from ZFC?
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
  Perhaps this depends on our definition of randomness. Kolmogorov defined
  randomness as a series that cannot be generated by any Turing machine
  shorter than the series (Wiki Randomness, mathematics). By this
  definition, it appears randomness exists if certain reals exist, which
  may be relevant to the continuum hypothesis.
\end{proof}

\begin{question}
  Can Turing machines prove their lack of randomness?
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
  In the same vein, if the universe were deterministic, would we ever know
  it? Similarly, if the universe were random, would we eventually find out?
\end{proof}
