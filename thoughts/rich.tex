\begin{question}
  By Simpson all hyperarithmetical sets are rich, and by Soare a
  poor set exists. Are there non-hyperarithmetical sets that are also
  rich?
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
  Yes. Consider the join $H\oplus P$ of a hyperarithmetical set $H$
  with a poor set $P$. Given arbitrary $X$ that computes $H\oplus P$,
  since $H$ is rich, it contains some subset $H_0\subset H$ that is
  Turing equivalent to $X$. Then $H_0\oplus\emptyset$ witnesses the
  richness of $H\oplus P$.
\end{proof}
